  FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY: Captioning sponsored by NEWSHOUR PRODUCTIONS, LLC  I KNOW MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN THE GENERALS,.  I HAVE SAT AT THAT TABLE IN THE SITUATION ROOM.  NOBODY KNOWS THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN ME. I ALONE CAN FIX IT.  GOING TO CLOSE MY CAMPAIGN FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS AND FAIRNESS FOR FAMILIES.  HILLARY FAILED ON THE ECONOMY, EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHED DIDN'T WORK OUT.  EVEN IF YOU'RE TOTALLY OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP, YOU MAY STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT ME.  Woodruff:  GOOD EVENING GWEN IFILV AWAY. WELCOME TO THE PBS "NEWSHOUR" SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON AND REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP. THE STAGE IS SET AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS AT A TIME WHEN THE MOST RECENT POLLS BOTH NATIONAL AND IN BATTLEGROUND STATES SHOW A SURGE IN SUPPORT FOR CLINTON. WHILE TRUMP'S NUMBERS HAVE BEEN SLIPPING, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE 2005 VIDEO WHERE HE'S HEARD USING LEWD LANGUAGE BOASTING ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE. THE MODERATOR, CHRIS WALLACE OF OF FOX NEWS ANNOUNCED AHEAD OF TIME THERE WILL BE SIX TOPICS TONIGHT NOT NECESSARILY IN THIS ORDER. DEBT AND ENTITLEMENT. IMMIGRATION. THE ECONOMY. THE SUPREME COURT. HOT SPOTS AND FITNESS TO BE PRESIDENT. WATCH IT ALL JOINING ME HERE AT THIS TABLE IN WASHINGTON OUR REGULAR "NEWSHOUR" CONTRIBUTORS SYNDICATED COLUMNIST MARK SHIELDS, "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST DAVID BROOKS AND AMY WALTER OF THE "COOK POLITICAL REPORT." WE'RE AT THIRD ONE AND IT WILL ALL BE OVER AFTER THIS, DAVID? DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO GO HIGH OR LOW?  PROMISE THIS WILL BE OVER? NO, I EXPECT HER TO GO HIGH HIM TO GO LOW. HE'S BEHIND SO HE'S GOT TO TRY SOME DESPERATE MOVE. THE QUICK FOR HER TO SEE IF SHE CAN BE STRONG ENOUGH TO REBUT WHATEVER HE SAYS WHILE STILL PROJECTING SOME SENSE OF POSITIVITY THAT WILL ATTRACT. MY BIG QUESTION, DO WE WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER AFTER THIS IS OVER. FEEL BETTER ABOUT OUR COUNTRY OR WORSE?  Woodruff:  LOW OR HIGH, MARK?  I THINK DONALD TRUMP WON THE NOMINATION, GOING AWAY, PREVAILED IN THE DEBATES BY EXPOSING AND PLAYING TO THE VULNERABILITIES AND WEAKNESSES OF HIS OPPONENTS. HE HAS TO CONCLUDE -- HE RATTLED THEM. HE BULLIED THEM. HE HAS TO SAY THAT HASN'T WORKED WITH HILLARY CLINTON. AFTER 26 DEBATES WITH BARACK OBAMA SHE'S FAR MORE FORMIDABLE THAN ANYBODY'S HE'S FACED. I THINK HE'S GOING TO --  Woodruff:  THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. YOUR HOME ALWAYS TOLD YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION. HI FIRST DEBATE SEALED THE STATE OF HIS CANDIDACY. HE CAN TRY TO COME BACK IN THE THIRD DEBATE GO AFTER HILLARY CLINTON MORE AGGRESSIVELY. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. THAT IS WHAT A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST TOLD ME HE NEEDS TO DO TONIGHT, JUST PUT IN ALL CAPS, E-MAILS, FOUNDATION, FAILED RECORDS E-MAILS FOUNDATION, FAILED RECORD. THAT IS I THINK --  GOOD EVENING FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS. I'M CHRIS WALLACE OF FOX NEWS. I WELCOME YOU TO THE THIRD AND FINAL OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES BETWEEN IS SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD J. TRUMP. THIS DEBATE SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, THE COMMISSION HAS DESIGNED THE FORMAT. SIX ROUGHLY 15-MINUTE SEGMENTS WITH TWO-MINUTE ANSWERS THEN OPEN DISCUSSION FOR THE REST OF EACH SEGMENT. BOTH CAMPAIGNS HAVE AGREED TO THOSE RULES. FOR THE RECORD, I DECIDED THE TOPICS AND THE QUESTIONS IN EACH TOPIC, NONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE COMMISSION OR THE TWO CANDIDATES. THE AUDIENCE HERE IN THE HALL HAS PROMISED TO REMAIN SILENCE NO CHOOSE, BOOS OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS SO WE AND YOU CAN FOCUS ON WHAT THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO SAY. NO NOISE, EXCEPT RIGHT NOW AS WE WELCOME THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT SECRETARY CLINTON AND THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT MR. TRUMP. [ Applause ] SECRETARY CLINTON, MR. TRUMP. WELCOME. LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT. THE FIRST TOP SICK THE SUPREME COURT. YOU BOTH TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT THE COURT IN THE LAST DEBATE BUT I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON THIS BECAUSE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE AT LEAST ONE APPOINTMENT AND LIKELY OR POSSIBLY TWO OR THREE APPOINTMENTS WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL IN EFFECT DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE COURT FOR WHAT COULD BE THE NEXT QUARTER CENTURY. FIRST OF ALL, WHERE YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT TAKE THE COUNTRY AND SECONDLY, WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON HOW THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED. IS IT JUST WORDS OR IS IT A LIVING DOCUMENT TO BE APPLIED FLEXIBLY ACCORDING TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES, IN THIS SEGMENT SECRETARY CLINTON YOU GO FIRST YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CHRIS THANKS TO UNLV FOR HOSTING US. YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT IT REALLY RACES THE CENTRAL ISSUE IN THIS ELECTION, WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO BE. WHAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES WILL WE PROVIDE FOR OUR CITIZENS WHAT KIND OF RIGHTS WILL AMERICANS HAVE. AND I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE SUPREME COURT NEEDS TO STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ON THE SIDE OF THE POWERFUL CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY. FOR ME, THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT WILL STAND UP ON BEHALF OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, ON BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY, THAT WILL STAND UP AND SAY NO TO CITIZENS UNITED, A DECISION THAT HAS UNDERMINED THE ELECTION SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT PERMITS DARK, UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY TO COME IN TO OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. I HAVE MAJOR DISAGREEMENTS WITH MY OPPONENT ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND OTHERS THAT WILL BE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. BUT I FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT REVERSE MARRIAGE EQUALITY, THAT WE NOT REVERSE ROE V. WADE, THAT WE STAND UP AGAINST CITIZENS UNITED, WE STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORKPLACE THAT WE STAND UP AND BASICALLY SAY, THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD REPRESENT ALL OF US. THAT'S HOW I SEE THE COURT AND THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT I WOULD BE LOOKING TO NOMINATE TO THE COURT. WOULD BE IN THE GREAT TRADITION OF STANDING UP TO THE POWERFUL STANDING UP ON BEHALF OF OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICANS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY, I WOULD HOPE THAT THE SENATE WOULD DO ITS JOB. AND CONFIRM THE NOMINEE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SENT TO THEM. THAT'S THE WAY THE CONSTITUTION FUNDAMENTALLY SHOULD OPERATE. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES AND THEN THE SEN CONSENTS OR NOT BUT THEY GO FORWARD WITH THE PROCESS.  SECRETARY CLINTON, THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP, SAME QUESTION, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT TAKE THE COUNTRY AND HOW DO YOU BELIEVE THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED?  WELL, FIRST OF ALL IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU AND THANK YOU EVERYBODY. THE SUPREME COURT IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. OUR COUNTRY IS SO IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT JUSTICES, SOMETHING HAPPENED RECENTLY WHERE JUSTICE GINSBURG MADE SOME VERY, VERY INAPPROPRIATE STATEMENTS TOWARD ME AND TOWARD A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT. AND SHE WAS FORCED TO APOLOGIZE. APOLOGIZE SHE DID. BUT THESE WERE STATEMENTS THAT SHOULD NEVER, EVER HAVE BEEN MADE. WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT IN MY OPINION IS GOING TO UPHOLD THE 2nd AMENDMENT, ALL AMENDMENT BUT THE 2nd AMENDMENT WHICH IS UNDER ABSOLUTE SIEGE. I BELIEVE AS MY OPPONENT SHOULD WIN THIS RACE, WHICH I TRULY DON'T THINK WILL HAPPEN, WE WILL HAVE A 2nd AMENDMENT WHICH WILL BE VERY, VERY SMALL REPLICA OF WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW. BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT WE UPHOLD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS UNDER SUCH TRAUMA, I FEEL THAT THE JUSTICES THAT I AM GOING TO APPOINT, THAT I NAMED 20 OF THEM, THE JUSTICES THAT I'M GOING TO APPOINT WILL BE PRO RIGHTS, THEY WILL HAVE CONSERVATIVE BENT, THEY WILL BE PROTECTING THE 2nd AMENDMENT THEY ARE GREAT SCHOLARS IN ALL CASES AND THEY ARE PEOPLE OF TREMENDOUS RESPECT. THEY WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THE FOUNDERS WANTED IT INTERPRETED. I BELIEVE THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE JUSTICES APPOINTED THAT DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION OF -- SO IMPORTANT THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I WILL APPOINT.  MR. TRUMP, THANK YOU. NOW HAVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES FOR OPEN DISCUSSION, I WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO ISSUES THAT IN FACT BY THE JUSTICES THAT YOU NAMED COEND D UP CHANGING THE EXISTING LAW OF THE LAND. FIRST, IS ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED, MR. TRUMP, THAT IS GUNS. SECRETARY CLINTON YOU SAID LAST YEAR, LET ME QUOTE, THE SUPREME COURT IS WRONG ON THE 2nd AMENDMENT NOW IN FACT IN THE 20 2008 CASE THE COURT RULED THAT THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, BUT A RIGHT THAT IS REASONABLY LIMITED. THOSE WERE THE WORDS OF THE JUDGE ANTONIN SCALIA, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?  WELL FIRST OF ALL I SUPPORT THE 2nd AMENDMENT. I LIVED IN ARKANSAS FOR 18 WONDERFUL YEARS, I REPRESENTED UPSTATE NEW YORK, I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE TRADITION OF GUN OWNERSHIP. IT GOES BACK TO THE FOUNDING OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE CAN BE AND MUST BE REASONABLE REGULATION. BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE 2nd AMENDMENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I WANT PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS TO BE ABLE TO THREATEN YOU KILL YOU OR MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY. SO, WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO, WE HAVE 33000 PEOPLE A YEAR WHO DIE FROM GUNS. I THINK WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS, NEED TO CLOSE THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE, CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, THERE'S OTHER MATTERS THAT I THINK ARE SENSIBLE, THAT ARE THE KIND OF REFORMS THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THAT ARE NOT IN ANY WAY CONFLICTING WITH THE 2nd AMENDMENT. YOU MENTIONED HOWARD DECISION WHAT I WAS SAYING, THAT YOU REFERENCED, CHRIS, WAS THAT I DISAGREED WITH THE WAY THE COURT APPLIED THE 2nd AMENDMENT IN THAT CASE. BECAUSE WHAT THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WAS TRYING TO DO WAS TO PROTECT TODDLERS FROM GUNS. AND SO THEY WANTED PEOPLE WITH GUNS TO SAFELY STORE THEM. AND THE COURT DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT REASONABLE REGULATION BUT THEY HAVE ACCEPTED MANY OTHERS. I SEE NO CONFLICT BETWEEN SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND DEFENDING THE 2nd AMENDMENT.  LET ME BRING MR. TRUMP IN HERE, THE BIPARTISAN OPEN DEBATE COALITION GOT BILLIONS OF VOTES ON QUESTIONS TO ASK HERE. THIS WAS IN FACT ONE OF THE TOP QUESTIONS THAT THEY GOT. HOW WILL YOU ENSURE THE 2nd AMENDMENT IS PROTECTED, YOU JUST HEARD SECRETARY CLINTON'S ANSWER. DOES SHE PERSUADE YOU THAT WHILE YOU MAY DISAGREE ON REGULATION SHE SUPPORTS A 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHT TO BEAR LAWS.  THE DC VERSUS TELLER DEVISION WAS VERY STRONGLY AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY ABOUT IT. I WATCHED. SHE WAS VERY, VERY ANGRY WHEN UPHELD. JUSTICE SCALIA WAS SO INVOLVED, IT WAS A WELL CRAFTED DECISION. BUT HILLARY WAS EXTREMELY UPSET EXTREMELY ANGRY AND PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN THE 2nd AMENDMENT AND BELIEVE IN IT VERY STRONGLY, WERE VERY UPSET WITH WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.  LET ME BRING IN SECRETARY CLINTON WERE YOU EXTREMELY UPSET IS?  I WAS UPSET BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY DOZENS OF TODDLERS INJURY THEMSELVES EVEN KILL PEOPLE WITH GUNS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY NOT EVERYONE WHO HAS LOADED GUNS IN THEIR HOMES TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS. BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT I RESPECT THE 2nd AMENDMENT THAT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. THAT IS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH SENSIBLE, COMMON SENSE REGULATION. AND, LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT DONALD'S BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE NRA, THE GUN LOBBY IS ON HIS SIDE THEY ARE RUNNING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ADS AGAINST ME. I REGRET THAT BECAUSE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOR PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND SAY, OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE 2nd AMENDMENT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT TRIES TO SAVE SOME OF THESE 43,000 LIVES THAT WE LOSE EVERY YEAR.  LET ME BRING MR. TRUMP BACK IN, BECAUSE IN FACT, YOU OPPOSED ANY LIMITS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS ANY LIMITS ON HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES, YOU SUPPORT A NATIONAL RIGHT TO CARRY LAW. WHY, SIR?   LET ME JUST TELL YOU BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER IN CHICAGO, WHICH HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, PROBABLY YOU COULD SAY BY FAR THEY HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE THAN ANY OTHER CITY. SO, WE HAVE THE TOUGHEST LAWS AND YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS GUN VIOLENCE. I AM A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE 2nd AMENDMENT, I DON'T KNOW IF HILLARY WAS SAYING IT IN SARCASTIC MANNER BUT I'M PROUD TO HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE NRA IS EARLIEST ENDORSEMENT IF HE OF THIS EVER GIVEN ANYBODY WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT. I'M VERY HONORED BY ALL OF THAT. WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES, THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP THE 2nd AMENDMENT, WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES THAT WILL FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE 2nd AMENDMENT, THAT WILL NOT DO DAMAGE TO THE 2nd AMOUNTMENT.  LET'S PICK UP ON ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH DIVIDES YOU. THE JUSTICE, IS THAT WHOEVER ENDS UP WINNING THAT ELECTION COULD HAVE DRAMATIC AFFECT THERE THAT'S THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. MR. TRUMP, YOU'RE PRO LIFE. I WOULDN'T ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY, DO YOU WANT THE COURT, INCLUDING THE JUSTICES THAT YOU WILL NAME, TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE WHICH INCLUDES, IN FACT STATES, A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO ABORTION. BECAUSE I AM PRO LIFE I WILL BE APPOINTING PRO LIFE JUDGES I WOULD THINK THAT WILL GO BACK TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES.  I'M ASKING YOU SPECIFICALLY --  IF THEY OVERTURN IT WILL GO BACK TO THE STATES.  WHAT I'M ASKING YOU, DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT OVERTURN, YOU JUST SAID YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT PROTECT THE 2nd AMENDMENT, DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT OVERTURN --  IF WE PUT ANOTHER TWO OR PERHAPS THREE JUSTICES ON THAT'S REALLY WHAT IS GOING -- THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THAT WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY IN MY OPINION BECAUSE I AM PUTTING PRO LIFE JUSTICES ON THE COURT. I WILL SAY THIS, IT WILL GO BACK TO THE STATES AND THE STATES WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION.  SECRETARY CLINTON?  I STRONGLY SUPPORT ROE V. WADE WHICH GUARANTEES A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A WOMAN TO MAKE THE MOST INTIMATE, MOST DIFFICULT IN MANY CASES DECISIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH CARE THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE. AND IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT IS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA. SO MANY STATES ARE PUTTING VERY STRINGENT REGULATIONS ON WOMEN BUT BLOCK THEM FROM EXERCISING THAT CHOICE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, WHICH OF COURSE PROVIDES ALL KINDS OF CANCER SCREENINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS FOR WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY. DONALD HALLS SAID HE'S IN FAVOR OF DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD EVEN SUPPORTED SHUTTING THE GOVERNMENT DOWN TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL DEFEND ROE V. WADE AND DEFEND WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO HAVE THAT TURNED BACK NOW. INDEED HE SAID WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED, THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR WOMEN WHO OBTAIN ADORESS I COULD JUST NOT BE MORE OPPOSED.  I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU CHANCE TO RESPOND I WANT TO ASK YOU SECRETARY CLINTON EXPLORE HOW FAR YOU BELIEVE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION GOES. YOU HAVE BEEN QUOTED AS SAYING, THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, YOU ALSO QUOTED AGAINST A BAN ON LATE-TERM PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTIONS. WHY?  BECAUSE, ROE V. WADE VERY CLEARLY SETS OUT THAT THERE CAN BE REGULATIONS ON ABORTION SO LONG AS THE LIFE AND THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AND WHEN I VOTED, AS A SENATOR I DID NOT THINK THAT THAT WAS THE CASE. THE KINDS OF CASES THAT FELL AT THE END OF PREGNANCY ARE OFTEN THE MOST HEARTBREAKING, PAINFUL DECISIONS FOR FAMILIES TO MAKE. I HAVE MET WITH WOMEN WHO TOWARD THE END OF THEIR PREGNANCY GET THE WORST NEWS ONE COULD GET THAT THEIR HEALTH IS IN JEOPARDY IF THEY CONTINUE TO CARRY TO TERM. OR THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED OR JUST BEEN DISCOVERED ABOUT THE PREGNANCY. I DO NOT THINK UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE STEPPING IN AND MAKING THOSE MOST PERSONAL OF DECISIONS. SO, YOU CAN REGULATE, IF YOU ARE DOING SO WITH THE LIFE AND THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  MR. TRUMP, YOUR REACTION, PARTICULARLY ON THIS ISSUE OF LATE-TERM PER SHALL BIRTH --  I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE IF YOU GO WITH WHAT HILLARY IS SAYING IN THE 9th MONTH YOU CAN TAKE THE BABY AND RIP THE BABY OUT OF THE WOMB OF THE MOTHER JUST PRIOR TO THE BIRTH OF THE BABY. NOW, YOU CAN SAY THAT THAT'S OKAY AND HILLARY CAN SAY THAT THAT'S OKAY. BUT IT'S NOT OKAY WITH ME. BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT SHE IS SAYING BASED ON WHERE SHE'S GOING AND WHERE SHE'S BEEN, YOU CAN TAKE THE BABY AND RIP THE BABY OUT OF THE WOMB. IN THE 9th MONTH. ON THE FINAL DAY. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.  THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE CASES. USING THAT KIND OF SCARE RHETORIC IS JUST TERRIBLY UNFORTUNATE. YOU SHOULD MEET WITH SOME OF THE WOMEN THAT I'VE MET WITH. WOMEN I'VE KNOWN OVER THE COURSE OF MY LIFE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST POSSIBLE CHOICES THAT ANY WOMAN AND HER FAMILY HAS TO MAKE. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE MAKING IT. I'VE HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF TRAVELING ACROSS THE WORLD ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY, I'VE BEEN TO COUNTRIES WHERE GOVERNMENT HAVE EITHER FORCED WOMEN TO HAVE ABORTIONS LIKE THEY USED TO DO IN CHINA OR FORCED WOMEN TO BEAR CHILDREN LIKE THEY USED TO DO IN ROMANIA. I CAN TELL YOU THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS IN THAT DECISION THAT WOMEN MAKE WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR FAITH, WITH MEDICAL ADVICE AND I WILL STAND UP FOR THAT RIGHT.  ALL RIGHT. JUST BRIEFLY I'M GOING TO MOVE ON --  NOBODY HAS BUSINESS DOING WHAT I JUST SAID, DOING THAT AS LATE AS ONE OR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR DAYS PRIOR TO BIRTH. NOBODY HAS THAT --  LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION. THERE IS ALMOST NO ISSUE THAT SEPARATES THE TWO OF YOU MORE THAN THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. ACTUALLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT SEPARATE THE TWO OF YOU. MR. TRUMP, YOU WANT TO BUILD A WALL. SECRETARY CLINTON YOU HAVE OFFERED NO SPECIFIC PLAN FOR HOW YOU WANT TO SECURE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. MR. TRUMP, YOU ARE CALLING FOR MAJOR DEPORTATIONS SECRETARY CLINTON YOU SAY THAT WITHIN YOUR FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT YOU'RE GOING TO OFFER A PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. THE QUESTION REALLYS WHY ARE YOU RIGHT AND YOUR OPPONENT WRONG? MR. TRUMP YOU GO FIRST YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.  FIRST OF ALL SHE WANTS TO GIVE AMNESTY WHICH IS A DISASTER, VERY UNFAIR TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE FOR MANY YEARS. WE NEED STRONG BORDERS. IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT WE HAVE FOUR MOTHERS OF -- THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW OF OVER A PERIOD OF YEAR WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN BRUTALLY KILLED BY PEOPLE THAT CAME INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND RELATIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE COMING IN ILLEGALLY DRUGS ARE POURING IN THROUGH THE BORDER. WE HAVE NO COUNTRY IF WE HAVE NO BORDER. HILLARY WANTS TO GIVE AMNESTY WANTS TO HAVE OPEN BORDERS, THE BORDERS -- THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, 16500 PLUS ICE LAST WEEK ENDORSED ME FIRST TIME THEY EVER ENDORSED A CANDIDATE. IT MEANS THEIR JOB IS TOUGHER. BUT THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THEY KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY  ANYBODY. THEY WANT STRONG BORDERS. THEY FEEL WE HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. I WAS UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE OTHER DAY, THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT THEY HAVE WITH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS GOING ON IN THE WORLD MANY OF THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HILLARY CLINTON AND BY BARACK OBAMA ALL OF THE PROBLEMS, SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS HEROIN THAT POURS ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDERS JUST POURING AND DESTROYING THEIR YOUTH. POISONING THE BLOOD OF THEIR YOUTH AND PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. WE HAVE TO KEEP THE DRUGS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW WE ARE GETTING THE DRUGS, THEY ARE GETTING THE CASH. WE NEED STRONG BORDERS WE NEED ABSOLUTE -- WE CANNOT GIVE AMNESTY. NOW, I WANT TO BUILD A WALL. WE NEED THE WALL. BORDER PATROL, ICE, ALL WANT THE WALL. WE STOP THE DRUGS, WE SHORE UP THE BORDER. ONE OF MY FIRST ACTS WILL TO BE GET ALL OF THE DRUG LORDS, ALL OF THE BAD ONES, WE HAVE SOME BAD, BAD PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE TO GO OUT. WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM OUT WE'RE GOING TO SECURITY BORDER AND ONCE THE BORDER IS SECURED AT A LATER DATE MAKE DETERMINATION AS TO THE REST. BUT WE HAVE SOME BAD HOMRES HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM OUT.  MR. TRUMP. THANK YOU. SAME QUESTION, TO YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON. BASICALLY, WHY ARE YOU RIGHT AND MR. TRUMP IS WRONG?  IF HE WAS TALKING I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOUNG GIRL I MET HERE IN LAS VEGAS, CARLA. WHO WAS VERY WORRIED THAT HER PARENTS MIGHT BE DEPORTED BECAUSE SHE WAS BORN IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THEY WERE NOT. THEY WORK HARD, THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GIVE HER A GOOD LIFE. AND, YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO RIP FAMILIES APART. I DON'T WANT TO BE SENDING PARENTS AWAY FROM CHILDREN. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE DEPORTATION FORCE THAT DONALD HAS TALKED ABOUT IN AKIN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE, THEY HAVE FOUR MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN CHILDREN. 15 MILLION PEOPLE. HE SAID AS RECENTLY AS A FEW WEEKS AGO IN PHOENIX THAT EVERY UNDOCUMENTED PERSON WILL BE SUBJECT TO DEPORTATION. NOW HERE IS WHAT THAT MEANS. IT MEANS YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MASSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE. WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WOULD BE GOING SCHOOL TO SCHOOL HOME TO HOME, BUSINESS TO BUSINESS, ROUNDING UP PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. AND WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO PUT THEM ON TRAINS, ON BUSES, TO GET THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. I THINK THAT IS AN IDEA THAT IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. I THINK IT'S AN IDEA THAT WOULD RIP OUR COUNTRY APART. I HAVE BEEN FOR BORDER SECURITY FOR YEARS. I VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND MY COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN OF COURSE INCLUDES BORDER SECURITY. BUT I WANT TO PUT OUR RESOURCES WHERE I THINK THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. GETTING RID OF ANY VIOLENT PERSON, ANYBODY WHO SHOULD BE DEPORTED WE SHOULD DEPORT THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL THAT DONALD TALKS ABOUT BUILDING, HE WENT TO MEXICO, HAD A MEETING WITH THE MEMBERS AN PRESIDENT DIDN'T EVEN RAISE IT, HE CHOKED. THEN GOT INTO A TWITTER WAR BECAUSE THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR THAT WALL. I THINK WE ARE BOTH A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS. AND THAT WE CAN ACT ACCORDINGLY THAT'S WHY I'M INTRODUCING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS FOR PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.  THANK YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON.  I THINK IT'S -- FIRST OF ALL I HAD VERY GOOD MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. VERY NICE MAN. WE WILL BE DOING VERY MUCH BETTER WITH MEXICO ON TRADE DEALS, BELIEVE ME. THE NAFTA DEAL SIGNED BY HER HUSBAND IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS OF ANY KIND SIGNED BY ANYBODY, IT'S A DISASTER. HILLARY CLINTON WANTED THE WALL. HILLARY CLINTON FOUGHT FOR THE WALL. IN 2006 OR THEREABOUTS. NOW, SHE NEVER GETS ANYTHING DONE SO NATURALLY THE WALL WASN'T BUILT. BUT HILLARY CLINTON WANTED THE WALL.  LET ME -- WEARER COUNTRY -- LET ME -- BY THE WAY -- WAIT I'D LIKE TO HEAR -- I'D -- I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM SECRETARY CLINTON.  I VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY. AND THERE ARE --  THE WALL.  THERE SOME ARE LIMITED PLACES WHERE THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE ALSO NECESSARILY GOING TO BE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND HOW BEST TO DEPLOY THAT. BUT IT IS CLEAR WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT DONALD HAS BEEN PROPOSING, HE STARTED HIS CAMPAIGN BASHING IMMIGRANTS, CALLING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS RACIST AND CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS. THAT HE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO DEAL WITH IMMIGRANTS. NOW, WHAT I AM ALSO ARGUING IS THAT BRINGING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OUT FROM THE SHADOWS PUTTING THEM INTO THE ECONOMY WILL BE GOOD, THEN EMPLOYERS CAN'T EXPLOIT THEM AND UNDERCUT AMERICAN WAGES DONALD KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THIS HE USED UDOCUMENTED LABOR TO BUILD THE TRUMP TOWER. HE UNDERPAID UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS, WHEN THEY COMPLAINED, HE BASICALLY SAID, WHAT A LOT OF EMPLOYERS DO YOU COMPLAIN I'LL GET YOU DEPORTED. I WANT TO GET EVERYBODY OUT OF THE SHADOWS, GET THE ECONOMY WORKING, NOT LET EMPLOYERS LIKE DONALD EXPLOIT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHICH HURTS THEM BUT ALSO HURTS AMERICAN WORKERS.  MR. TRUMP?  PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS MOVED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT. NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT, NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. BUT UNDER OBAMA MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOVED OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SAY THAT. BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED BIG LEAGUE. AS FAR AS MOVING THESE PEOPLE OUT AND MOVING -- WE'RE A COUNTRY OF LAWS, WE EITHER HAVE A BORDER OR WE DON'T. YOU CAN COME BACK IN AND YOU CAN BECOME A CITIZEN BUT IT'S VERY UNFAIR, WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT DID IT THE RIGHT WAY, THEY'RE WAITING. WE'RE GOING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS BIG LEAGUE, BECAUSE IT'S VERY INEFFICIENT. BUT THEY'RE ONLINE, WAITING TO BECOME CITIZENS, VERY UNFAIR THAT SOMEBODY RUNS ACROSS THE BORDER, BECOMES A CITIZEN UNDER HER PLAN YOU HAVE OPEN BORDERS, YOU WOULD HAVE A DISASTER ON TRADE, YOU WILL HAVE A DISASTER WITH YOUR OPEN BOARDERS.  I WANT TO -- -- S THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DEPORTED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE JUST THE WAY --  SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO --  WE WILL NOT HAVE OPEN BORDERS.  LET ME ASK YOU -- THAT IS A RANK MISCHARACTERIZATION.  SECRETARY CLINTON.  WE HAIL HAVE SECURE BORDERS BUT ALSO HAVE REFORM. THIS USED TO BE BIPARTISAN ISSUE. RONALD REAGAN --  EXCUSE ME SECRETARY CLINTON --   AND GEYER SUPPORTED IT AS WELL.  I WANT TO SEE YOUR POSITION ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE SPEECH YOU GAVE TO BRAZILIAN BANK FOR WHICH YOU WERE PAID $225,000 WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE WIKILEAK, IS THAT YOU SAID THIS. I WANT TO QUOTE. MY DREAM IS A HEMISPHERE RICK COMMON MARKET WITH OPEN TRADE AND OPEN BORDERS.  THANK YOU.  THAT'S THE QUESTION. PLEASE QUIET EVERYBODY. IS THAT YOUR DREAM, OPEN BORDERS?  WELL, IF YOU WENT TON READ THE REST OF THE SENTENCE I WAS TALKING ABOUT ENERGY. WE TRADE MORE ENERGY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS THAN WE TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. I DO WANT US TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC GRID, AN ENERGY SYSTEM THAT CROSSES BORDERS, I THINK THAT WILL BE GREAT BENEFIT TO US. BUT, YOU ARE VERY CLEARLY QUOTING FROM WIKILEAKS WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT WIKILEAKSS IS THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ENGAGED IN ESPIONAGE AGAINST AMERICANS. THEY HAVE HACKED AMERICAN WEBSITES, AMERICAN ACCOUNTS OF PRIVATE PEOPLE OF INSTITUTIONS. THEN THEY HAVE GIVEN THAT INFORMATION  WIKILEAKS FOR THE PURPOSE MUCH PUTTING IT ON THE INTERNET. THIS HAS COME FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. CLEARLY FROM POUT IN HIMSELF, IN AN EFFORT AS 17 OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE CONFIRMED TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. I ACTUALLY THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF THIS EVENING, CHRIS, IS FINALLY WILL DONALD TRUMP ADMIT AND CONDEMN THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING THIS. AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE THE HELP OF PUTIN IN THIS ELECTION, THAT HE REJECTS RUSSIAN ESPIONAGE AGAINST AMERICANS, WHICH HE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED IN THE PAST. THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE NEED ANSWERED. WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN ANY OF OUR ELECTIONS BEFORE.  THAT WAS A GREAT PIVOT OFF THE FACT THAT SHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS. HOW DID WE GET OFF TO PUTIN?  HOLD ON, WAIT. HOLD ON FOLKS. THIS IS GOING TO END UP GETTING OUT OF CONTROL. LET'S TRY TO KEEP IT QUIET FOR CANDIDATES AND FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  JUST IS TO FINISH ON THE BORDERS SHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME IN FROM SYRIA, SHE WANTS 550% MORE PEOPLE THAN BARACK OBAMA HE HAS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY COME FROM AND YOU SEE WE ARE GOING TO STOP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM IN THIS COUNTRY. SHE WON'T EVEN MENTION THE WORDS, NEITHER WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU SHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT POUT IN. I DON'T KNOW POUT IN. HE SAID NICE THINGS. IF WE GOT ALONG WELL THAT WOULD BE GOOD. IF RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES GOT ALONG WELL WENT AFTER ISIS, THAT WOULD BE GOOD. HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HER. HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR OUR PRESIDENT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE IN VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUNTRY WITH TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF NUCLEAR WARHEADS, 1800 BY THE WAY, WHERE THEY EXPANDED WE DIDN'T. 1800 NUCLEAR WARHEADS AND SHE'S PLAYING CHICKEN. LOOK PUTIN FROM EVERYTHING I SEE HAVE 240 RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON.  THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D RATHER HAVE A PUPPET AS PRESIDENT.  NO PUPPET.  IT'S PRETTY CLEAR -- YOU'RE THE PUPPET.  IT'S CLEAR YOU WON'T ADMIT --   YOU'RE THE PUPPET.  RUSSIANS HAVE ENGAGED IN CYBERATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BUT YOU ENCOURAGE ESPYIANAGE AGAINST OUR PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPOUT THE PUTIN LINE, SIGN UP FOR HIS WISH LIST, RAKE UP NATO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO. AND THAT YOU CONTINUE TO GET HELP FROM HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A VERY CLEAR FAVORITE IN THIS RACE. I THINK THAT THIS IS SUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION, WE'VE NEVER HAD A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TRYING TO INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTION. WE HAVE 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES  AGENCIES, CIVILIAN AND MILITARY WHO HAVE ALL CONCLUDED THAT THESE ESPIONAGE ATTACKS, THESE CYBERATTACKS COME FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE KREMLIN AND THEY ARE DESIGNED TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. I FIND THAT DEEPLY DISTURBING.  SECRETARY CLINTON -- I HIT IT'S -- SHE HAS NO IDEA WHETHER IT'S RUSHA CHINA --  I'M NOT QUOTING MYSELF I AM --  YOU HAVE NO IDEA.  -- DO YOU DOUBT 17 INTELLIGENCE --  HAVE NO IDEA.  WELL, YOU HAVE -- VLADIMIR PUTIN THE MILITARY AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US. I FIND THAT --  SHE DOESN'T LIKE PUTIN BECAUSE HE -- HE OUTSMARTED HER --  MR. TRUMP, EXCUSE ME.  HE HAS OUTSMARTED HER IN -- MR. TRUMP I'M NOT -- I JUST GOT TO -- I DO GET TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU THIS DIRECT QUESTION. THE TOP NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS OF THIS COUNTRY DO BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA HAS BEEN BEHIND THE ATTACKS. EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER THEY ARE DO YOU CONDEMN ANY INTERFERENCE BY RUSSIA IN THE AMERICAN ELECTION?  BY RUSSIA OR ANYBODY ELSE.  YOU CONDEMN THEY'RE INTERFERENCE.  OF COURSE I CONDEMN. I DON'T KNOW PUTIN.  I'M ASKING YOU -- THIS IS NOT MY BEST FRIEND. IF THE UNITED STATES GOT ALONG WITH RUSSIA COULDN'T BE SO BAD. LET ME TELL YOU PUTIN HAS OUTSMARTED HER AND OBAMA AT EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY. WHETHER IT'S SYRIA. YOU NAME IT. MISSILES, TAKE A LOOK AT THE START-UP THAT THEY SIGNED. RUSSIANS HAVE SAID ACCORDING TO MANY, MANY REPORTS, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ALLOW THIS TO DO THIS. THEY CREATE WARHEADS WE CAN'T. RUSSIANS CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SHE HAS BEEN OUTSMARTED BY PUTIN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST, THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER. WE'VE SPENT $TRILLION THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER THE MIDDLE EAST. SHE HAS BEEN OUTED SMARTED AND OUTPLAYED WORSE THAN ANYBODY I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY GOVERNMENT WHATSOEVER.  WE'RE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM IMMIGRATION BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU FINISH THIS -- 45 SECONDS.  SHE ALWAYS WILL BE.  I FIND IT IRONIC THAT HE'S RAISING NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THIS IS A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN VERY CAVALIER, EVEN CASUAL ABOUT THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE'S ADVOCATED MORE COUNTRIES GETTING THEM JAPAN KOREA, EVEN SAUDI ARABIA. HE'S SAID, WELL, WE HAVE THEM WHY DON'T WE USE THEM. WHICH I THINK IS TERRIFYING. BUT HERE IS THE DEAL. BOTTOM LINE ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS, THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT GIVES THE ORDER IT MUST BE FOLLOWED. THERE'S ABOUT FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THE ORDER BEING GIVEN AND THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR LAUNCHING NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO DO SO. THAT'S WHY TEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THAT AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY HAVE COME OUT IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY SAID THEY WOULD NOT TRUST DONALD TRUMP WITH THE NUCLEAR CODE OR TO HAVE HIS FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR BUTTON  BUTTON.  I HAVE 200 GENERALS AND ADMIRALS, 21 ENDORSING ME. 21 CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS, AS FAR AS JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE BEING RIPPED OFF BY EVERYBODY -- WE'RE DEFENDING OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE SPENDING A FORTUNE DOING IT. THEY HAVE THE BARGAIN OF THE CENTURY, ALL I SAID IS WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE THESE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE POUR COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD TO DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA, JAPAN, GERMANY, SOUGHT KOREA MANY OTHER PLACES WE CANNOT CONTINUE -- SHE TOOK THAT AS SAYING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. LOOK, SHE'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE A LIAR ON SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER LIE.  I'M JUST QUOTING YOU WHEN -- THERE'S NO QUOTE. NOT GOING TO FIND A ME.  NUCLEAR COMPETITION IN ASIA, YOU SAID, GO AHEAD, ENJOY YOURSELVES, FOLKS. THAT KIND OF --  AND DEFEND YOURSELVES.  THE UNITED STATES -- DEFEND YOURSELVES.  UNITED STATES HAS KEPT THE PEACE THROUGH OUR ALLIANCES. DONALD WANTS TO TEAR UP OUR ALLIANCES, I THINK IT MAKES THE WORLD SAFER AND FRANKLY MAKES THE UNITED STATES SAFER. I WOULD WORK WITH OUR ALLIES IN ASIA, IN EUROPE, IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ELSEWHERE. THAT IS ONLY WAY WE'RE --  NO, WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC WHICH IS THE ECONOMY. I HOPE WE HANDLE THAT AS WELL AS WE DID IMMIGRATION. YOU ALSO HAVE VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO GET THE ECONOMY GROWING FASTER. SECRETARY CLINTON, IN YOUR PLAN, GOVERNMENT PLAYS A BIG ROLE. MORE ENTITLEMENTS, MORE TAX CREDITS AND PENALTIES. MR. TRUMP YOU WANT TO GET GOVERNMENT OUT WITH LOWER TAXES AND LESS REGULATION. WE'RE GOING TO DRILL DOWN INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN THIS OVEIEW, PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR PLAN WILL CREATE MORE JOBS AND GROWTH FOR THIS COUNTRY AND YOUR OPPONENT'S PLAN WILL NOT. IN THIS ROUND YOU GO FIRST SECRETARY CLINTON.  I THINK WHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS THRIVES, AMERICA THRIVES. MY PLAN IS BASED ON GROWING THE ECONOMY, GIVING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES. I WANT US TO HAVE THE BIGGEST JOB PROGRAM SINCE WORLD WAR II. JOBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, I THINK WE CAN COMPLETE WITH HIGH WAGE COUNTRIES AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD. NEW JOBS AND CLEAN ENERGY NOT ONLY TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, BUT TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW BUSINESSES. I WANT US TO DO MORE TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS, THAT'S WHERE TWO-THIRDS OF THE NEW JOBS ARE GOING TO COME FROM. I WANT US TO RAISE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN POVERTY SHOULD NOT -- WORK FULL TIME SHOULD NOT STILL BE IN POVERTY. I SURE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO. I FEEL STRONGLY WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT STARTS PRESCHOOL GOES THROUGH COLLEGE THAT'S WHY I MONTH WANT MORE TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. REAL APPRENTICESHIPS TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE AND FOR FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $125,000. YOU WILL NOT GET A TUITION BILL FROM A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IF THE PLAN THAT I WORKED ON WITH BERNIE SANDERS IS ENACTED. WE'RE GOING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO GO WHERE THE MONEY IS. MOST OF THE GAINS IN THE LAST YEARS SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION HAVE GONE TO THE VERY TOP. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE WEALTHY PAY THEIR FAIR CHERYL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CORPORATIONS MAKE A CONTRIBUTION GREATER THAN THEY ARE NOW TO OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS A PLAN THAT HAS BEEN ANALYZED BY INDEPENDENT EXPERTS WHICH SAID THAT, IT COULD PRODUCE TEN MILLION NEW JOBS. BY CONTRAST DONALD'S PLAN HAS BEEN ANALYZED TO CONCLUDE IT MIGHT LOSE 3.A MILLION JOBS. WHY? BECAUSE HIS WHOLE PLAN TO CUT TAXES, GIVE BIGGEST TAX BREAKS EVER TO THE WEALTHY AND TO CORPORATIONS. ADDING $20 TRILLION TO OUR DEBT AND PAUSING THE KIND OF DISLOCATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE, BECAUSE IT TRULY WILL BE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS ON STEROIDS. SO THE PLAN I HAVE I THINK WILL ACTUALLY PRODUCE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES, THE PLAN HE HAS WILL COST US JOBS AND POSSIBLY LEAD TO ANOTHER GREAT RECESSION.  SECRETARY THANK YOU, SOME OF THERE ARE UM, WHY WILL YOUR PLAN CREATE MORE JOBS AND GROWTH THAN SECRETARY CLINTON'S?  FIRST OF ALL I SAID HER PLAN IS GOING TO RAISE TAXES AND EVEN DOUBLE YOUR TAXES. HER TAX PLAN IS A DISASTER. SHE CAN SAY ALL SHE WANTS ABOUT COLLEGE TUITION AND I'M A BIG PROPONENT, WE'RE GOING TO DO A LOT OF THINGS FOR COLLEGE TUITION BUT THE REST OF THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO BE PAYING FOR IT. WE'LL HAVE A MASSIVE MASSIVE TAX INCREASE UNDER HILLARY CLINTON'S PLAN. I'D LIKE TO START OFF WHERE WE LEFT, BECAUSE WHEN I SAID JAPAN AND GERMANY, I'M NOT JUST SINGLING THEM OUT, THESE ARE VERY RICH, POWERFUL COUNTRIES. SAUDI ARABIA, NOTHING BUT MONEY. WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA. WHY AREN'T THEY PAYING? SHE IMMEDIATELY WHEN SHE HEARD THIS I QUESTIONED IT. I ASKED WHY ISN'T NATO PAYING, SINCE I DID THIS, THIS WAS A YEAR AGO ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE PAYING. I'VE BEEN GIVEN LOT OF CREDIT FOR IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE STARTING TO PAY UP. THEY HAVE TO PAY UP FOR PROTECTING PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TO PAY UP. I'M A BIG FAN OF NATO. THEY HAVE TO PAY UP. SHE COMES OUT SAID, WE LOVE OUR ALLIES, WE THINK OUR ALLIES ARE GREAT. WELL, IT'S AWFULLY HARD TO GET THEM TO PAY UP WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SAYING, WE THINK OUT GREAT THEY ARE. WE HAVE TO TELL JAPAN, YOU HAVE VERY NICE WAY, HAVE TO TELL GERMANY ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES SOUTH COREY A, YOU HAVE TO HELP US OUT. WE HAVE DURING HIS REGIME PRESIDENT OBAMA'S REGIME WE'VE DOUBLED OUR NATIONAL DEBT. WE'RE UP TO $20 TRILLION. SO MY PLAN WE'RE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE TRADE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE FREE TRADE THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE HORRIBLE DEALS. OUR JOBS ARE BEING TAKEN OUT BY DEAL THAT HER HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER. OUR JOBS ARE BEING SUCKED OUT OF OUR ECONOMY. YOU LOOK AT ALL. PLACES THAT I JUST LEFT, YOU TO GO PENNSYLVANIA, YOU TO GO OHIO, YOU TO GO FLORIDA, YOU TO GO ANY OF THEM, YOU GO UPSTATE NEW YORK, OUR JOBS HAVE FLED TO MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES. WE'RE BRINGING OUR JOBS BACK. I'M GOING TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, IF I CAN'T MAKE A GREAT DEAL WE'RE GOING TO TERMINATE NAFTA CREATE NEW DEALS. WE'LL HAVE TRADE. WE'RE GOING TO TERMINATE IT, MAKE A GREAT TRADE DEAL. IF WE CAN'T WE'RE GOING TO DO IT -- GO A SEPARATE WAY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A DISASTER. WE ARE GOING TO CUT TAXES MASSIVELY. WE'RE GOING TO CUT BUSINESS TAXES MASSIVELY. GOING TO START HIRING PEOPLE, GO TO BRING $2.3 TRILLION --  BUT THE -- WE'RE GOING TO START THE ENGINE ROLLING AGAIN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW --  MR. TRUMP -- OUR COUNTRY IS DYING AT 1% GP.    LET ME TRANSLATE IF I CAN CHRIS.  YOU CAN'T.  THE AS A MATTER OF FACT HE'S GOING TO ADVOCATE FOR LARGEST TAX CUTS WE'VE EVER SEEN. THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE TAX CUTS UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON ANY ONE MAKING $250,000 OR LESS. I ALSO WILL NOT ADD A PENNY TO THE DEBT. I HAVE COSTED OUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, HE WILL DO HIS MASSIVE TAX CUTS ADD $20 TRILLION TO THE DEBT. HE MENTIONED THE DEBT. WE KNOW HOW TO GET CONTROL OF THE DEBT. WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT WE WENT FROM $300 BILLION DEFICIT TO A $200 BILLION SUR PLUS WE WERE ACTUALLY ON THE PATH TO ELIMINATING THE NATIONAL DEBT. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE HE INHERITED THE WORST ECONOMIC DISASTER SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. HE HAS CUT THE DEFICIT BY TWO-THIRDS. YES, ONE OF THE WAYS YOU GO AFTER THE DEBT ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CREATE JOBS IS BY INVESTING IN PEOPLE. SO, I DO HAVE INVESTMENTS IN NEW JOBS, INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION, SKILL TRAINING AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT'S THE KIND OF --  MRS. SECRETARY.  CUTTING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY IT HAS NOT WORKED THE WAY THAT IT HAS BEEN --  I WANT TO PURSUE YOUR PLAN. BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS IT IS SIMILAR TO THE OBAMA STIMULUS PLAN IN 2009. WHICH HAS LED TO THE SLOWEST GDP GROWTH SINCE 1949.  CORRECT.  THANK YOU, SIR. YOU TOLD ME IN JULY WHEN WE SPOKE THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T GET TO DO ENOUGH IN WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THE STIMULUS S. YOUR PLAN BASICALLY MORE -- EVEN MORE OF THE OBAMA STIMULUS?  WELL, IT'S A COMBINATION CHRIS. LET ME SAY THAT WHEN YOU INHERIT THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE THAT HE INHERITED IT WAS A REAL TOUCH AND CAN SITUATION. I WAS IN THE SENATE BEFORE I CAME SECRETARY MUCH STATE. I'VE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE AS PHYSICALLY DISTRAUGHT AS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TEAM WAS BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE ECONOMY. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THE STEPS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK SAVED THE ECONOMY, HE DOESN'T GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR TAKE SOMEBODY VERY HARD POSITION. BUT IT WAS A TERRIBLE RESECTION. SO, NOW WE'VE DUG OURSELVES OWL OF IT, WE'RE STANDING -- WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING. WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS THAT WE INVEST FROM THE MIDDLE OUT AND THE GROUND UP. NOT THE TOP DOWN. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. THAT'S WHY WHAT I HAVE PUT FORWARD DOESN'T ADD A PENNY TO THE DEBT, BUT IT IS THE KIND OF APPROACH THAT WILL ENABLE MORE PEOPLE TO TAKE THOSE NEW JOBS, HIGHER PAYING JOBS. WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME INCREASE IN INCOME. WE CERTAINLY HAVE HAD A LONG STRING --   LET ME DASH --  WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO GET THE WHOLE ECONOMY MOVING AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I WILL BE ABLE TO DO.  MR. TRUMP EVEN CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS WHO LOOKED AT YOUR PLAN SAY THAT THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP. THAT YOUR IDEA, YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT 25 MILLION JOBS CREATED 4% --  OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD.  IS UNREALISTIC. THEY SAY YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT GROWING THE ENERGY INDUSTRY, WITH OIL PRICES AS LOW AS THEY ARE THAT'S UNREALISTIC AS WELL. YOUR RESPONSE.  I JUST LEFT SOME HIGH REPRESENTATIVES OF INDIA THEY ARE GROWING AT 8%. CHINA IS GROWING AT 7%. AFTER THEM IS A CATASTROPHICALLY LOW NUMBER. WE ARE GROWING OUR LAST REPORT CAME OUT AND IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE 1% LEVEL AND I THINK IT'S GOING DOWN. LAST WEEK AS YOU KNOW, END OF LAST WEEK, THEY CAME OUT WITH AN ANEMIC JOBS REPORT. TERRIBLE JOBS REPORT. IN FACT I SAID IS THAT THE LAST JOBS REPORT BEFORE THE ELECTION? BECAUSE IF IT IS I SHOULD WIN EASILY. IT WAS SO BAD. THE REPORT OF SO BAD. LOOK, OUR COUNTRY IS STAGNANT, WE'VE LOST OUR JOBS, WE'VE LOST OUR BUSINESSES, WE'RE NOT MAKING THINGS ANY MORE RELATIVELY SPEAKING. OUR PRODUCT IS POURING IN FROM CHINA, POURING IN FROM VIETNAM, FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. I'VE VISITED SO MANY COMMUNITIES, THIS HAS BEEN SUCH INCREDIBLE EDUCATION FOR ME CHRIS, I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW SO MANY -- DEVELOPED SO MANY FRIENDS OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND THEY CRY WHEN THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED. I PASS FACTORIES THAT WERE THRIVING 20, 25 YEARS AGO. BECAUSE OF THE BILL THAT HER HUSBAND SIGNED SHE BLESSED 100%, IT IS JUST HORRIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THESE PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES. SHE CAN SAY THAT HER HUSBAND DID WELL. BOYD THEY SUFFER AS NAFTA KICKED IN BECAUSE IT DIDN'T KICK IN VERY MUCH BUT AFTER THEY LEFT. BOY, DID THEY SUFFER. THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT'S EVER BEEN SIGNED BY OUR COUNTRY. SHE WANTS TRANSPACIFIC -- SHE LIED WHEN SHE DIDN'T CALL IT THE GOLD STANDARD, SHE TOTALLY LIED. SHE DID CALL IT THE GOLD STANDARD THEY ACTUALLY FACT CHECKED THEY SAID I WAS RIGHT.  I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER THEN PIVOT --  THAT WILL BE ON -- IS IS OBAMACARE, GO AHEAD BRIEFLY.  LET ME SAY, NUMBER ONE, WHEN I SAW THE FINAL AGREEMENT FOR TPP I SAID I WAS AGAINST IT, IT DIDN'T MEET MY TEST. I HAVE HAD THE SAME TEST, CREATE JOBS, RAISE INCOME, FURTHER OUR NATIONAL SECURITY I'M AGAINST IT NOW, I'LL BE AGAINST IT AFTER THE ELECTION, I'LL BE AGAINST IT WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. ONLY ONE OF US ON THIS STAGE WHO HAS ACTUALLY SHIPPED JOBS TO MEXICO BECAUSE THAT'S DONALD, HE WAS SHIPPING JOBS TO 12 COUNTRIES INCLUDING MEXICO. HE MENTIONED CHINA. ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH CHINA IS THE ILLEGAL DUMPING OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM INTO OUR MARKETS. I HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THAT AS SENATOR, STOOD UP AGAINST" AS SECRETARY OF STATE. DONALD HAS BOUGHT CHINESE STEEL AND ALUMINUM, THE TRUMP HOTEL RIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS WAS MADE WITH CHINESE STEEL. HE GOES AROUND WITH CROCODILE STEERS HOW TERRIBLE IT IS, BUT HE HAS GIVEN JOBS TO CHINESE STEELWORKERS, NOT AMERICAN STEELWORKERS THAT'S THE KIND OF --  MR. TRUMP -- JUST NOT GOING TO WORK. IF YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER WE HAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT WE ENFORCE THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO HAVE A TRADE PROSECUTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THOSE AGREEMENTS. AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR BUSINESSES THAT --  SECRETARY CLINTON.  BY BUYING AMERICAN PRODUCTS.  I ASKED THE SIMPLE QUESTION. SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS, WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU DO IT OVER THE LAST 15, 20 YEARS. YOU WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED -- EXCUSE ME, MY TURN. YOU WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS COUNTRY VERY MUCH. YOU DO HAVE EXPERIENCE. I SAY ONE THING YOU HAVE OVER ME IS EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE DONE HAS TURNED OUT BADLY. FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN POSITION HELP, IF YOU SAY THAT I USE STEEL OR I USE SOMETHING ELSE, I MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO -- I WOULDN'T MIND. THE PROBLEMS YOU TALK BUT YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE, HILLARY. YOU DON'T. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU RAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT, $6 BILLION WAS MISSING. HOW DO YOU MISS $6 BILLION? U RAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. $6 BILLION WAS EITHER STOLEN -- I DON'T KNOW -- IT'S GONE, $6 BILLION. IF YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE IN SOME MESS. BELIEVE ME.  WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT HE JUST SAID ABOUT STATE DEPARTMENT IS NOT ONLY UNTRUE IT'S BEEN DEBUNKED NUMEROUS TIMES. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE HE RAISED THE 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. LET ME JUST TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW BACK IN THE 1907s I WORKED FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND I WAS TAKING ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS AND SCHOOLS. HE WAS GETTING SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN HIS APARTMENT BUILDINGS. IN THE 1980s, I WAS WORKING TO REFORM SCHOOLS IN ARKANSAS. HE HE WAS BORROWING $14 MILLION FROM HIS FATHER TO START HIS BUSINESSES. IN THE 1990s I WENT TO BEIJING I SAID WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. HE INSULTED A FORMER MISS UNIVERSE, ALICIA MACHADO CALLED HER AN EATING MACHINE. ON THE DAY WHEN I WAS IN THE SITUATION ROOM MONITORING THE BROUGHT OSAMA BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE HE WAS HOSTING THE CELEBRITY APPRENTICE. I'M HAPPY TO COMPARE MY 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, WHAT HIVE DONE FOR THIS COUNTRY, TRYING TO HELP IN EVERY WAY I COULD ESPECIALLY KIDS AND FAMILIES GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD WITH YOUR 30 YEARS. I'LL LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE THAT DECISION.  I THINK DID I MUCH BETTER JOB BY BUILDING MASSIVE COMPANY SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WORTH MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I STARTED WITH A $1 MILLION LOW, I AGREE THAT, IT'S A $1 MILLION LOW I BUILT PHENOMENAL COMPANY. IF WE COULD RUN OUR COUNTRY THE WAY I'VE RUN MY COMPANY, WE WOULD HAVE A COUNTRY THAT YOU WOULD BE SO PROUD OF. YOU WOULD EVEN BE PROUD OF IT. FRANKLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER REAL RECORD, TAKE A LOOK AT SYRIA. TAKE A LOOK AT THE MIGRATION. TAKE A LOOK AT LIBYA, TAKE A LOOK AT IRAQ. SHE GAVE US ISIS BECAUSE HER AND OBAMA CREATED THIS HUGE VACUUM AND SMALL GROUP CAME OUT OF THAT HUGE VACUUM BECAUSE -- WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN IRAQ, ONCE THEY WERE THERE, SHOULD HAVE NEVER GOT OUT THE WAY THEY WANTED. TO SHE GAVE US ISIS AS SURE YOU ARE SITTING THERE, WHAT HAPPENED IS NOW ISIS IS IN 32 COUNTRIES. NOW HOW SHE'S GOING TO GET RID OF ISIS? SHE'S GOING TO GET RID OF NOBODY.  ALL RIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO GET TO FOREIGN HOT SPOTS. BUILT NEXT SEGMENT IS FITNESS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. MR. TRUMP, AT THE LAST DEBATE YOU SAID YOUR TALK ABOUT GRABBING WOMEN WAS JUST THAT, TALK. AND THAT YOU'VE NEVER ABSOLUTELY DONE IT. SINCE THEN, AS WE ALL KNOW, NINE WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD AND SAID THAT YOU EITHER GROPED THEM OR KISSED THEM WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. WHY WOULD SO MANY DIFFERENT WOMEN FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER SO MANY DIFFERENT YEARSY WOULD THEY ALL IN THIS LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS MAKE UP -- YOU DENY THIS -- MAKE UP THESE STORIES AND SINCE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU SECRETARY CLINTON MR. TRUMP SAYS WHAT YOUR HUSBAND DID AND THAT YOU DEFENDED WAS EVEN WORSE. MR. TRUMP, YOU GO FIRST.  FIRST OF ALL, THIS HAS BEEN LARGELY DEBUNKED, I DON'T KNOW THOSE PEOPLE. I HAVE A FEELING HOW THEY CAME. I BELIEVE IT WAS HER CAMPAIGN THAT DID IT. JUST LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT CAME OUT TODAY ON THE CLIPS WHERE I WAS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY RALLY IN CHICAGO. OTHER RALLIES WHERE WE HAD SUCH VIOLENCE. SHE'S THE ONE AND OBAMA THAT CAUSED THE RALLIES. THEY HIRED PEOPLE, THEY PAID THEM $15 00 THEY ARE ON TAPE SAY BE VIOLENT, CAUSE FIGHTS, DO BAD THINGS. I WOULD SAY THE ONLY WAIL -- BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL TOTALLY FALSE I HAVE TO SAY THAT. I DIDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE TO MY WIFE WHO IS SITTING RIGHT HERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THESE WOMEN. I DIDN'T SEE THESE WOMEN. THESE WOMEN THE ONE ON THE PLANE, I THINK THEY WANT EITHER FAME OR HER CAMPAIGN DID IT. I THINK IT'S HER CAMPAIGN. BECAUSE WHAT I SAW WHAT THEY DID, WHICH IS A CRIMINAL ACT, BY THE WAY, WHERE THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO OUT START FIST FIGHTS AND START VIOLENCE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IN PARTICULAR IN CHICAGO, PEOPLE WERE HURT AND PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THAT RIOT. THAT WAS NOW ALL ON TAPE STARTED BY HER. I BELIEVE CHRIS, THAT SHE GOT THESE PEOPLE TO STEP FORWARD. IF IT WASN'T TO GET THEIR TEN MINUTES OF FAME. BUT THEY WERE ALL TOTALLY -- IT WAS ALL FICTION, IT WAS LIES, IT WAS FICTION.  SECRETARY CLINTON?  AT THE LAST DEBATE, WE HEARD DONALD TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO WOMEN. AND AFTER THAT, A NUMBER OF WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD SAYING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID TO THEM. NOW, WHAT WAS HIS RESPONSE. WELL, HE HELD A NUMBER OF BIG RALLIES WHERE HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE THOSE THINGS TO THOSE WOMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH FOR --  DID I NOT SAY THAT.  IN FACT YOU WENT ON TO SAY -- HER TWO MINUTES, SIR.  BUT DID NOT SAY THAT.  HER TWO MINUTES.  HE WENT ON TO SAY, LOOK AT HER, I DON'T THINK SO. ABOUT ANOTHER WOMAN, HE SAID THAT WOULDN'T BE MY FIRST CHOICE. HE ATTACKED THE WOMAN REPORTER CALLED HER DISGUSTING AS HE HAS CALLED A NUMBER OF WOMEN DURING THIS CAMPAIGN. DONALD THINKS BELITTLING WOMEN MAKES HIM BIGGER. HE GOES AFTER THEIR DIGNITY THEIR SELF WORTH, I DON'T THINK THERE IS A WOMAN ANYWHERE WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHO THAT FEELS LIKE. SO, WE NOW KNOW WHAT DONALD THINKS AND WHAT HE SAYS AND HOW HE ACTS TOWARDS WOMEN. THAT'S WHO DONALD IS. I THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO ALL OF US TO DEMONSTRATE WHO WE ARE AND WHO OUR COUNTRY IS. AND TO STAND UP AND BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT FROM OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. HOW WE WANT TO BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE KIND OF PITTING OF PEOPLE, ONE AGAINST THE OTHER. WHERE INSTEAD WE CELEBRATE OUR DIVERSITY, WE LIFT PEOPLE UP. AND WE MAKE OUR COUNTRY EVEN GREATER. AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE AMERICA IS GOOD. AND IT REALLY IS UP TO ALL OF US TO MAKE THAT TRUE, NOW AND IN THE FEW FEWER AND PARTICULARLY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN.  MR. TRUMP, D.A. -- NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN MORE THAN I DO.  PLEASE, EVERYBODY.  FRANKLY HAS BEEN LARGELY DEBUNKED, I REALLY WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. SHE MENTIONS THIS WHICH IS ALL FICTION, ALL FICTION LIES. PROBABLY OR POSSIBLY STARTED BY HER AND HER VERY SLEEZY CAMPAIGN. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT FICTIONALIZED HER E-MAILS WHERE SHE DESTROYED 33,000 E-MAILS CRIMINALLY. CRIMINALLY. AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FBI, I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVE A GREAT GENERAL, FOUR-STAR GENERAL TODAY YOU READ IT IN ALL THE PAPERS POTENTIALLY SERVE FIVE YEARS IN JAIL FOR LYING TO THE FBI. ONE LIE. SHE'S LIED HUNDREDS OF TIMES TO THE PEOPLE, TO CONGRESS AND TO THE FBI. HE'S GOING TO PROBABLY GO TO JAIL, THIS IS A FOUR-STAR GENERAL AND SHE GETS AWAY WITH IT AND SHE CAN RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES? THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. NOT FICTION. WHERE SOMEBODY WANTS FAME OR WHETHER THEY COME OUT OF HER CROOKED CAMPAIGN.  SECRETARY CLINTON.  WELL, EVERY TIME DONALD IS PUSHED ON SOMETHING, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE LIKE WHAT THESE WOMEN ARE SAYING, HE IMMEDIATELY GOES TO DENYING RESPONSIBILITY AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WOMEN. HE NEVER APOLOGIZES OR SAYS HE'S SORRY FOR ANYTHING. SO, WE KNOW WHAT HE HAS SAID WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN. BUT HE ALSO WENT AFTER DISABLED REPORTER,.  WRONG.  HE WENT AFTER MR. AND MRS. KH  MRS. KHAN PARENTS OF A YOUNG MAN WHO DIED SERVING OUR COUNTRY GOLD STAR FAMILY BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION. HE WENT AFTER JOHN McCAINA PRISONER OF WAR SAID HE PREFERS PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CAPTURED. HE WENT AFTER A FEDERAL JUDGE BORN IN INDIANA BUT WHO DONALD SAID COULDN'T BE TRUSTED TO TRY THE FRAUD AND RACKETEERING CASE AGAINST TRUMP UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE HIS PARENTS WERE MEXICAN. SO, IF NOT ONE THING, THIS IS A PATTERN. A PATTERN OF DIVISIVENESS, OF A VERY DARK AND IN MANY WAYS DANGEROUS VISION OF OUR COUNTRY. WHERE HE ENCITES VIOLENCE, WHERE HE APPLAUDS PEOPLE WHO ARE PUSHING AND PULLING AND PUNCHING AT HIS RALLIES. THAT IS NOT WHO AMERICA IS. AND I HOPE THAT AS WE MOVE IN THE LAST WEEKS OF THIS CAMPAIGN, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE.  SO SAD WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT VIOLENCE AT MY RAM LEASE AND SHE CAUSED THE VIOLENCE.  DURING THE LAST -- THE OTHER THINGS ARE FALSE BUT HONESTLY, I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT GETTING RID OF ISIS. I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS.  OKAY.  BUT THOSE OTHER CHARGES AS SHE KNOWS --   IN THIS ABOUT FITNESS TO BE PRESIDENT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS SINCE THE LAST DEBATE. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THEM. THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE. SECRETARY CLINTON, DURING YOUR 2009 SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING YOU PROMISED TO AVOID EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH YOUR DEALING WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WHILE YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT E-MAILS SHOW THAT DONORS GOT SPECIAL ACCESS TO YOU THOSE SEEKING GRANTS FOR HAITI RELIEF WERE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY FROM NON-DONORS AND SOME OF THOSE DONORS GOT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TAXPAYER MONEY, CAN YOU REALLY SAY THAT YOU KEPT YOUR PLEDGE TO THAT SENATE COMMITTEE WHY ISN'T WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN YOU AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHY ISN'T IT WHAT MR. TRUMP CALLS, PAY TO PLAY.  WELL, EVERYTHING I DID AS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS FURTHERANCE OF OUR COUNTRY'S INTERESTS AND OUR VALUES. STATE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID THAT, I THINK THAT'S BEEN PROVEN, BUT I AM HAPPY, IN FACT I AM THRILLED TO TALK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT IS A WORLD RENOWNED CHARITY. AND I AM SO PROUD OF THE WORK THAT IT DOES. I COULD TALK FOR THE REST OF THE DEBATE, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO THAT, BUT JUST BRIEFLY, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR 11 MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WITH HIV AIDS TO AFFORD TREATMENT. THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE GETTING TREATMENT. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN --  SECRETARY CLINTON -- WITH THE HEALTH ASSOCIATION WE'VE MADE ENVIRONMENTS IN SCHOOLS --  SECRETARY CLINTON -- RESPECTFULLY THIS IS AN OPEN DISCUSSION --  IT IS AN OPEN DISCUSSION.  SPECIFIC QUESTION TO PAY FOR PRAY.  IT'S BEEN VERY WELL -- LET'S LET --  IT'S BEEN VERY WELL -- VERY GOOD WORK -- IT'S A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. SAUDI ARABIA GIVING $25 MILLION. QATAR, ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES YOU TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT PUSH GAYF OFF BUILDINGS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT KILL WOMEN AND TREAT WOMEN HORRIBLY YET YOU TAKE THEIR MONEY. SO, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE BACK THE MONEY THAT YOU'VE TAKEN FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES THAT TREAT CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE SO HORRIBLY. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE BACK THE MONEY? I THINK WAIT BE GREAT GESTURE. BECAUSE SHE TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OF HAITI. I WAS IN LITTLE HAITI THE OTHER DAY IN FLORIDA. I WANT TO TELL YOU THEY HATE THE CLINTONS. BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN HAITI WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS A DISGRACE. YOU KNOW IT. THEY KNOW IT. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.  SECRETARY CLINTON.  VERY QUICKLY, WE AT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SPEND 90% -- 90% OF ALL THE MONEY THAT IS DONATED ON BEHALF OF PROGRAMS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. THE HIGHEST RATING FROM THE WATCH DOGS THAT FOLLOW FOUNDATION. I'D BE HAPPY TO COMPARE WHAT WE DO WITH THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, WHICH TOOK MONEY FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND BOUGHT SIX FOOT PORTRAIT OF DONALD. WHO DOES THAT? IT JUST WAS ASTONISHING. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HAITI, HEY THEE IS THE POOREST COUNTRY IN OUR HEMISPHERE, THE EARTHQUAKE AND HURRICANES, IT HAS DEVASTATED HAITI. BILL AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO HELP HAITI FOR MANY YEARS. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RAISED $30 MILLION TO HELP HAITI AFTER THE CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE AND ALL OF THE TERRIBLE PROBLEMS THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE. WE'VE DONE THINGS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES, AGRICULTURAL AND SO MUCH ELSE. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE AMERICAN --  I WOULDN'T -- THEY DON'T WANT YOUR HELP ANY MORE. I'D LIKE TO MENTION ONE THING. TRUMP FOUNDATION, SMALL FOUNDATION. PEOPLE CONTRIBUTE, I CONTRIBUTE. MONEY GOES 100% -- 100 EARS GOES TO DIFFERENT CHARITIES INCLUDING MILITARY. I DON'T GET ANYTHING. I DON'T BUY BOATS. I DON'T BUY PLANES. WHAT HAPPENS --  WASN'T SOME OF THE MONEY USED TO SETTLE YOUR LAWSUIT, SIR?  NO. WE PUT UP THE AMERICAN FLAG AND THAT'S IT. THEY PUT UP THE AMERICAN FLAG. WE FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT --  THERE WAS A PENALTY THAT WAS I AM POLESSED BY PALM BEACH COUNTY --  BY THE WAY, HOT MONEY -- THE MONEY WENT TO FISHER HOUSE WHERE THEY BUILD HOUSES -- THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WENT TO FISHER HOUSE WHERE THEY BUILT HOUSES FOR VETERANS --  I WANT TO GET INTO ONE -- THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THAT IS TRUE BECAUSE HE HASN'T RELEASED TAX RETURN. FIRST CANDIDATE EVER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE LAST 40-PLUS YEARS WHO HAS NOT RELEASED TAX RETURN. EVERYTHING HE SAYS ABOUT CHARITY OR ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN'T PROVE IT. YOU CAN LOOK AT OUR TAX RETURNS WE'VE GOT THEM ALL OUT L. BUT WHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING, IS THAT WE LEARNED IN THE LAST DEBATE HE HAS NOT PAID A PENNY IN FEDERAL INCOME TAX. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS A FEW MINUTES AGO, CHRIS. YOU KNOW HALF OF ALL IMMIGRANTS, UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN OUR COUNTRY ACTUALLY PAY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. SO, WE HAVE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN AMERICA WHO ARE PAYING MORE FEDERAL INCOME TAX THAN A BILLIONAIRE. I FIND THAT --  LET KNEE JUST TELL YOU VERY -- WE'RE ENTITLED BECAUSE OF THE PLUS THAT PEOPLE LIKE HER PASSED TO TAKE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DEPRECIATION ON OTHER CHARGES. WE DO IT. ALL OF OTHER DONORS JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM, BUFFETT TOOK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SOROS GEORGE, TOOK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS -- LET ME JUST EXPLAIN. MOST OF HER DONORS --  MR. TRUMP --  YOU KNOW WHAT SHE -- FOLKS, YOU -- SHOULD YOU HAVE CHANGED THE LAW --  WE HEARD 24 -- BECAUSE YOUR DONORS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AS EYE DO EXCEPT MORE SO. YOU SHOULD HAVE CHANGED THE LAW BUT YOU WON'T CHANGE THE LAW BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN SO MUCH MONEY. I SAT IN MY APARTMENT TODAY ON VERY BEAUTIFUL HOTEL DOWN THE STREET, KNOWN AS --   PAID WITH CHINESE STEEL.  I SAT THERE WATCHING AD AFTER AD AFTER AD -- FALSE ADS, ALL PAID FOR BY YOUR FRIENDS ON WALL STREET THAT GAVE SO MUCH MONEY, BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO PROTECT THEM, FRANKLY SHOULD YOU HAVE JUST --  MR. TRUMP -- YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT DID I YOU SHOULD HAVE CHANGED THE LAW.  I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT ONE LAST QUESTION IN THIS TOPIC. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING AT RALLIES RECENTLY THAT THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED. AND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO STEAL IT. YOUR RUNNING MATE PLEDGED ON SUNDAY THAT HE AND YOU, HIS WORDS, WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION TODAY, YOUR DAUGHTER WE VANG COULD SAID THE SAME THING. I WOULDN'T ASK YOU HERE ON THIS STAGE TONIGHT, DO YOU MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY, SIR, THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION.  I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING NOW. I'LL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. WHAT I'VE SEEN, WHAT I'VE SEEN IS SO BAD. FIRST OF ALL THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST AND SO CORRUPT AND PIE ON SO AMAZING ARE "NEW YORK TIMES" WROTE AN ARTICLE, BUT THEY DON'T CARE. IT'S SO DISHONEST, THEY HAVE POISONED THE MINDS OF THE VOTERS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM, I THINK THE VOTERS ARE SEEING THROUGH IT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO SEE THROUGH IT. WE'LL FIND OUT.  BUT SIR -- IF YOU LOOK, EXCUSE ME, CHRIS. IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR VOTER ROLLS YOU WILL SEE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, MILLIONS -- THIS ISN'T COMING FROM ME THIS IS COMING FROM A REPORT, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE THAT SHOULDN'T BE REGISTERED TO VOTE. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE OTHER THING. I TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPT MEDIA, THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, TELL YOU ONE OTHER THING. SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RUN. IT'S CROOKED. SHE'S GUILTY OF VERY SERIOUS CRIME. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN. AND JUST IN THAT RESPECT I SAY IT'S RIGGED. BECAUSE SHE SHOULD NEVER -- CHRIS, SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS.  BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT PREPARED NOW TO --  WHAT I'M SAYING THAT I WILL TELL YOU AT THE TIME. I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE.  WELL, CHRIS, LET ME RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HORRIFYING. EVERY TIME DONALD THINKS THINGS ARE NOT GOING IN HIS DIRECTION HE CLAIMS WHATEVER IT IS IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THE FBI CONDUCTED A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION INTO MY E-MAILS, THEY CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO CASE. HE SAID THE FBI WAS RIGGED. HE LOST THE IOWA CAUCUS, THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY, HE SAID THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WAS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THEN TRUMP UNIVERSITY GETS SUED FOR FRAUD AND RACKETEERING, HE CLAIMS THE COURT SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL JUDGE IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THERE WAS EVEN A TIME WHEN HE DIDN'T GET AN EMMY FOR HIS TV PROGRAM THREE YEARS IN A ROW HE STARTED TWEETING THAT THE EMMYS WERE RIGGED --  SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT.  THIS IS A MINDSET. THIS IS HOW DONALD THINKS. AND IT'S FUNNY, BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY TROUBLING. THAT IS NOT THE WAY OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS. WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR 240 YEARS. WE'VE HAD FAIRY PLEX, EVE ELECTED THE OUTCOMES WHEN WE MAY NOT HAVE LIKED THEM. AND THAT IS WHAT MUST BE EXPECTED OF ANYONE STANDING ON A DEBATE STAGE DURING A GENERAL ELECTION. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU'RE WHINING --  HOLD ON FOLKS.  IT JUST SHOWS YOU'RE NOT UP TO DOING THE JOB. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE IS SAYING WHAT THAT MEANS. HE IS DENIGRATING TALKING DOWN OUR DEMOCRACY I FOR ONE AM APPALLED THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS THE NOMINEE OF ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR PARTIES WOULD TAKE THAT KIND OF POSITION.  I THINK WHAT THE FBI DID AND WHAT DEPARTMENT MUCH JUSTICE DID INCLUDING MEETING WITH HER HUSBAND, THE ATTORNEY, IN THE BACK OF AIRPLANE ON THE TARMAC IN ARIZONA I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL. I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE.  ALL RIGHT -- WE'VE NEVER HAD A SITUATION --  HOLD ON FOLKS. THIS DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD FOR ANYONE. PLEASE CONTINUE THE DEBATE MOVE ON TO THE SUBJECT OF FOREIGN HOT SPOTS. THE IRAQI OFFENSE TO TAKE BACK MOSUL HAS BEGUN. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN PUSHING ISIS OUT OF THAT IS HE OUT OF ALL OF IRAQ THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES, WHAT HAPPENS THE DAY AFTER. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WHICHEVER OF YOU ENDS UP -- WHOEVER OF ENDS UP AS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONFRONT. WILL YOU PUT U.S. TROOPS IN TO THAT VACUUM TO MAKE SURE THAT ISIS DOESN'T COME BACK OR ISN'T REPLACED BY SOMETHING EVEN WORSE, SECRETARY CLINTON YOU GO FIRST YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.  WELL, I AM ENCOURAGED THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT LED BY THE IRAQI ARMY SUPPORTED BY CONSIDEREDDISH FORCES AND ALSO GIVEN THE HELP AND ADVICE FROM THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL FORCES AND OTHER AMERICANS ON THE GROUND. BUT I WILL NOT SUPPORT PUTTING AMERICAN SOLDIERS INTO IRAQ AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE. I DON'T THINK THAT IS IN OUR INTEREST. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE SMART TO DO. IN FACT, CHRIS, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIG RED FLAG WAVING FOR ISIS TO RECONSTITUTE ITSELF. THE GOAL HERE IS TO TAKE BACK MOSUL, IT'S GOING TO BE A HARD FIGHT. I'VE GOT NO ALLUSIONS ABOUT THAT THEN CONTINUE TO PRESS INTO SYRIA TO BEGIN TO TAKE BACK AND MOVE ON THE ISIS HEADQUARTERS. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE HARD WORK THAT AMERICAN MILITARY ADVISORS HAVE DONE WILL PAY OFF. AND THAT WE WILL SEE A REALLY SUCCESSFUL MILITARY OPERATION. BUT WE KNOW WE'VE GOT LOTS OF WORK TO DO. SYRIA WILL REMAIN A HOT BED OF TERRORISM AS LONG AS THE CIVIL WAR IDED AND ABETTED BY IRANIANS AND RUSSIANS CONTINUE. SO, I HAVE SAID, LOOK, WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYE ON ISIS. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENCE SURGE THAT PROTECTS US HERE AT HOME, WHY WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THEM FROM THE AIR, ON THE GROUND, ONLINE. WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HERE AT HOME WE DON'T LET TERRORISTS BY WEAPONS IF YOU'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO FLY YOU'RE DO DANGEROUS BUY GUN. I'M CAN TO GO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR A NOLES AND SAFE HAVENS WITHIN SYRIA, NOT ONLY TO HELP PROTECT THE SYRIANS AND PREVENT THE DO CONSTANT OUT FLOW OF REFUGEES BUT TO FIGHT TO GAIN SOME LEVERAGE ON BOTH SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE RUSSIANS SO THAT PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE THE KIND OF SYRIA -- SERIOUS NEGOTIATION NECESSARY TO BRING THE CONFLICT TO AN END AND GO FORWARD ON A POLITICAL TRACK.  MR. TRUMP, SAME QUESTION, IF WE ARE ABLE TO PUSH ISIS OUT OF MOSUL AND OUT OF IRAQ, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PUT U.S. TROOPS IN THERE TO PREVENT THEIR RETURN, OR SOMETHING ELSE?  LET ME TELL YOU MOSUL IS SO SAD. WE HAD MOSUL. BUT WHEN SHE LEFT, WHEN SHE TOOK EVERYBODY OUT, WE LOST MOSUL NOW WE'RE FIGHT ENGINE GET MOSUL. WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO IS THEY WANTED TO GET THE LEADERS OF ISIS, WHO THEY FELT WERE IN MOSUL. ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO I STARTED READING THAT THEY WANT TO GET THE LEADERS. THEY ARE GOING TO ATTACK MOSUL. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE? OKAY? WE ANNOUNCE WE'RE GOING AFTER MOSUL. I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THIS FOR ABOUT -- HOW LONG, HILLARY THREE MONTHS? THESE PEOPLE NEVER LEFT. THEY OF A ALL LEFT. THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE. GEORGE, PATTON, SPINNING IN THEIR GRAVES WHEN THEY SEE THE STUPIDITY OF OUR COUNTRY. SO WE'RE NOW FIGHTING FOR MOSUL ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS SAY THATth NOW WE'RE GOING IN AGAIN. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIG WINNER IN MOSUL IS GOING TO BE AFTER WE EVENTUALLY GET IT. ONLY REASON THEY DID IT IS BECAUSE SHE'S RUNNING FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. THEY WANT TO LOOK TOUGH. THEY WANT TO LOOK GOOD. SHE VIOLATED THE RED LINE IN THE SAND. AND MADE SO MANY MISTAKES, MADE ALL MISTAKES THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE GREAT MIGRATION. BUT SHE WANTED TO LOOK GOOD FOR THE ELECTION. SO THEY'RE GOING IN -- WHO IS GOING TO GET MOSUL, REALLY? WE'LL SAY MOSUL EVENTUALLY. BY THE WAY, IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING, MUCH TOUGHER THAN THEY THOUGHT. MUCH, MUCH TOUGHER, MUCH MORE DANGEROUS GOING TO BE MORE -- BUT THE LEADERS THAT WE WANTED TO GET ARE ALL GONE BECAUSE THEY'RE SMART. SO MOSUL IS GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL THING, IRAN SHOULD WRITE US A LETTER OF THANKS. JUST LIKE THE REALLY STUPIDEST DEAL OF ALL TIME, A DEAL THAT'S GOING TO GIVE IRAN ABSOLUTELY NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IRAN SHOULD WRITE US YET ANOTHER LETTER SAYING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BECAUSE IRAN AS I SAID MANY YEARS AGO, IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO DO FOREVER BUT WE'VE MADE IT SO EASY FOR THEM. WE'RE NOW GOING TO TAKE MOSUL YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARY, IRAN. BOY ARE THEY MAKING -- THEY ARE OUTSMARTING -- LOOK, YOU'RE NOT THERE, YOU MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THAT DECISION, BUT YOU WERE THERE WHEN YOU TOOK EVERYBODY OUT OF MOSUL AND OUT OF IRAQ. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN IRAQ. YOU DID VOTE FOR IT. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN IRAQ, ONCE YOU WERE IN IRAQ, YOU SHOULD --  SIR -- THE POINT --  YOUR TWO MINUTES ARE UP.  THE WIN SERGE GO TO BE IRAN.  ONCE AGAIN, DONALD IS IMPLYING THAT HE DIDN'T SUPPORT THE INVASION OF IRAQ. I SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE. I'VE SAID THAT YEARS AGO. HE HAS CONSISTENTLY DENIED WHAT IS --  WRONG.  A VERY CLEAR FACT THAT -- WRONG.  BEFORE INVASION HE SUPPORTED IT. AND, YOU KNOW, ITS JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO GO GOOGLE IT. GOOGLE DONALD TRUMP IRAQ. YOU WILL SEE THE DOZENS OF SOURCES WHICH VERIFY THAT HE WAS FOR THE INVASION OF IRAQ.  WRONG.  YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE AUDIO OF HIM SAYING THAT. NOW, WHY DOES THAT MATTER? WELL, IT MATTERS BECAUSE HE HAS NOT TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT POSITION. I GUESS HE BELIEVES IT MAKES HIM LOOK BETTER NOW TO CONTRAST WITH ME BECAUSE I DID VOTE FOR IT. BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE INTERPLAY. MOSUL IS A SUNNI CITY. MOSUL IS ON THE BORDER OF SYRIA. AND, YES WE DO NEED TO GO AFTER BAGHDADI. JUST LIKE WE WENT AFTER BIN LADEN. WHILE YOU WERE DOING CELEBRITY APPRENTICE WE BROUGHT HIM TO JUSTICE. WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE LEADERSHIP, BUT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM, GET RID OF THEIR FIGHTERS, THEIR ESTIMATED SEVERAL THOUSAND FIGHTERS IN MOSUL THEY HAVE BEEN DIGGING UNDERGROUND, PREPARED TO DEFEND. GOING TO BE TOUGH FIGHTING. BUT I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT MOSUL THEN WE CAN MOVE ON INTO SYRIA AND TAKE BACK ROCCA. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. I'M JUST AMAZED THAT HE SEEMS TO THINK THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AND OUR ALLIES AND EVERYBODY ELSE LAUNCHED THE ATTACK ON MOSUL TO HELP ME IN THIS ELECTION. BUT THAT'S HOW DONALD THINKS. HE ALWAYS -- LOOKING FOR SOME --  BECAUSE WE DON'T GAIN ANYTHING. IRAN IS MAKING --  SECRETARY CLINTON -- BUT WE DON'T -- HE SAID -- IF THEY --  SECRETARY PLENTY TON IT'S AN OPEN DISCUSSION.  WOULD HAVE GAINED -- SECRETARY CLINTON --  APPROVES IT EVERY TIME.  YOU ARE THE ONE THAT IS UNFIT. WIKILEAKS CAME OUT, JOHN PODESTA SAID SOME HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT YOU. AND, BOY WAS HE RIGHT. HE SAID SOME BEAUTIES. YOU KNOW, BERNIE SANDERS HE SAID YOU HAVE BAD JUDGMENT. YOU DO. IF YOU THINK THAT GOING IN TO MOSUL AFTER WE LET THE WORLD KNOW WE'RE GOING IN, ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE REALLY WANTED, THE LEADERS, THEY'RE ALL GONE. IF YOU THINK THAT WAS GOOD, THEN YOU DO. NOW, JOHN PODESTA SAID YOU HAVE TERRIBLE INSTINCTS. BERNIE SANDERS SAID YOU HAVE BAD JUDGMENT, I AGREE WITH BOTH.  YOU SHOULD ASK BERNIE SANDERS WHO HE IS SUPPORTING --  WHICH IS A BIG CAM. I CAMPAIGNS, YOU'RE THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF AMERICA. I THINK HE'S RIGHT.  LET'S TURN TO OWE HELP POE. YOU WERE BOTH ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE SHEERIAN CITY OF ALEPPO I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE YOU SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THAT DEBATE WHICH WERE NOT TRUE, SIR. YOU SAID THAT ALEPPO HAS BASICALLY FALLEN, IN FACT --  IT'S A CATASTROPHE.  THERE ARE QUARTER -- HAVE YOU SEEN IT?  SIR -- HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED TO --  CAN I FINISH MY QUESTION?  IT HASN'T FALLEN, TAKE A LOOK AT IT.  THERE ARE QUARTER OF MILLION PEOPLE STILL LIVING THERE.  THEY ARE BEING SLAUGHTERED.  YES.  BECAUSE OF BAD DECISIONS.  I MAY JUST FINISH HERE. YOU ALSO SAID THAT SYRIA AND RUSSIA ARE BUSY FIGHTING ISIS IN FACT THEY HAVE BEEN THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN BOMBING AND SHELLING EASTERN ALEPPO AND THEY JUST ANNOUNCED HUMANITARIAN CAUSE IN EFFECT ADMITTING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BOMBING AND --  YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLEAR THAT UP.  ALEPPO IS HUMANITARIAN NIGHTMARE. BUT IT HAS FALLEN FROM -- FROM ANY STANDPOINT, WHAT DO YOU NEED A SIGNED DOCUMENT? TAKE A LOOK? IT'S SO SAD WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED. A LOT OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF HILLARY CLINTON. BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED IS, BY FIGHTING ASSAD WHO TURNED OWL TO BE LOT TOUGHER THAN SHE THOUGHT NOW SHE'S GOING TO SAY, HE LOVES ASSAD. HE'S JUST MUCH TOUGHER AND MUCH SMARTER THAN HER AND OBAMA. EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS -- TWO YEARS AGO, THREE YEARS AGO HE ALIGNED WITH RUSSIA, HE NOW ALSO ALIGNED WITH IRAN. WHO WE MADE VERY POWERFUL. GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. GIVE THEM $1.7 BILLION IN CASH. I MEAN, CASH. BUNDLES OF CASH AS BIG AS THIS STAGE. WE GAVE THEM $1.7 BILLION. NOW, THEY HAVE -- HE HAS ALIGNED WITH RUSSIA AND WITH IRAN. THEY DON'T WANT ISIS. BUT THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE WE ARE BACKING REBELS. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE REBELS ARE. WE'RE GIVING THEM LOTS OF MONEY, LOTS OF EVERYTHING. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE REBELS ARE. AND WHEN AND IF -- IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE BECAUSE YOU HAVE RUSSIA AND IRAN NOW, IF THEY EVER DID OVERTHROW ASSAD, MIGHT END UP WITH AS BAD AS ASSAD S. HE'S A BAD GUY. BUT YOU MAY VERY ELLEN UP WITH WORSE THAN ASSAD. IF SHE DID NOTHING, WE'D BE MUCH BETTER SHAPE. AND THIS IS WHAT'S CAUSED THE GREAT MIGRATION WHERE SHE'S TAKING IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SYRIAN REFUGEES WHO PROBABLY, IN MANY CASES -- NOT PROBABLY, WHO ARE DEFINITELY --  LET LET ME.  ISIS ALIGNED WE NOW HAVE THEM IN OUR COUNTRY AND WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE GREAT TROJAN HORSE. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE -- LOTS OF LUCK, HILLARY THANKS FOR DOING A GREAT JOB.  SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT, IN THE LAST DEBATE AGAIN TODAY, YOU WOULD IMPOSE A NOLES TO TRY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF ALEPPO. PRESIDENT OBAMA REFUSED TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO DRAW US CLOSER OR DEEPER BOOT CONFLICT. GENERAL JOSEPH DUNFORD CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF YOU WOULDN'T IMPOSE NO FLY ZONE CHANCES ARE YOU'LL GET INTO A WAR, HIS WORDSW SYRIA AND RUSSIA SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS, IF YOU IMPOSE A NO FLY ZONE, FIRST OF ALL HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THEIR CONCERNS. SECONDLY IF YOU IMPOSE THAT AND RUSSIAN PLANE VIOLATES THAT, DOING PRESIDENT CLINTON SHOOT THAT PLANE DOWN?  FIRST OF ALL, I THINK A NO FLY ZONE COULD SAVE LIVES AND COULD HASTEN THE END OF THE CONFLICT. I AM WELL AWARE OF THE REALLY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED FROM BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE GENERAL. THIS WOULD NOT BE DONE JUST ON THE FIRST DAY. THIS WOULD TAKE A LOT OF NEGOTIATION, IT WOULD ALSO TAKE MAKING IT CLEAR TO THE RUSSIANS AND SYRIAN, IS THAT OUR PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE SAFE ZONES ON THE GROUND. WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LEAVE SYRIA. AND THOSE MILLIONS EVER PEOPLE INSIDE SYRIA WHO HAVE BEEN DISLOCATED. SO I THINK WE COULD STRIKE A DEAL, MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE RUSSIANS AND THE SYRIANS THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA, IT WOULD HELP US WITH OUR FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. BUT I WANT TO RESPOND TO WHAT DONALD SAID ABOUT REFUGEES, HE'S MADE THESE CLAIMS REPEATEDLY. I AM NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE INTO THIS COUNTRY WHO IS NOT VETTED, WHO WE DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN. BUT I AM NOT GOING TO SLAM THE DOOR ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THAT PICTURE OF THAT LITTLE 4-YEAR-OLD BOY IN ALEPPO WITH THE BLOOD COMING DOWN HIS FACE WHILE HE SAT IN AN AMBULANCE IS HAUNTING. SO, WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY CAREFUL, THOROUGH VETTING. THAT DOES NOT SOLVE OUR INTERNAL CHALLENGES WITH ISIS. AND YOU ARE OUR NEED TO STOP. TO WORK WITH AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES WHO ARE THE FRONT LINES TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT ATTACKS. IN FACT, THE KILLER OF THE DOZENS OF PEOPLE AT THE NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO, THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB, WAS BORN IN QUEENS THE SAME PLACE DONALD WAS BORN. SO, LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE THREAT IS AND HOW WE ARE BEST GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET I. AND, YES SOME THAT HAVE THREAT EMANATES FROM OVER IN SHEER I CAN'T AND IRAQ AND WE'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING, I WILL DEFEAT ISIS AND SOME OF IT IS WE HAVE TO UP OUR GAME AND BE MUCH SMARTER HERE.  I WOULDN'T GET INTO OUR FINAL SEGMENT --  I JUST HAVE TO -- IT'S SO RIDICULOUS WHAT SHE -- SHE WILL DEFEAT ISIS. SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET ISIS HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN 32 COUNTRIES.  OKAY -- NE SECOND. THEY HAD -- A CEASE FIRE THREE WEEKS AGO, UNITED STATES, RUSSIA SYRIA. DURING THE CEASE FIRE RUSSIA TOOK OVER FAST SWATCHES OF LAND THEN THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT CEASE FIRE ANY MORE. WE ARE SO OUTPLAYED ON -- WE'RE -- UPON CEASE FIRES THEY ARE OUTPLAYED. SHE WASN'T THERE I ASSUME SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. BUT OUR COUNTRY IS SO OUTPLAYED BY PUTIN AND ASSAD AND --  OKAY.  AND BY IRAN, NOBODY CAN BELIEVE HOW STUPID OUR LEADERSHIP IS.  MR. TRUMP, SECRETARY CLINTON, NO, WE NEED TO MOVE TON OUR FINAL SEGMENT THAT IS THE NATIONAL DEBT. WHICH IS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED UNTIL TONIGHT. OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY, OUR GDP NOW 77% THAT'S THE HIGHEST SINCE JUST AFTER WORD WAR II. BUT THE NONPARTISAN COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET SAYS SECRETARY CLINTON UNDER YOUR PLAN DEBT WOULD RISE TO 86% OF GPD, MR. TRUMP UNDER YOUR PLAN THEY SAY WOULD RISE TO 105% OF GDP OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE QUESTION IS, WHY ARE BOTH OF YOU IGNORING THIS PROBLEM, MR. TRUMP GO YOU FIRST.  THEY'RE WRONG BECAUSE I'M GOING TO CREATE TREMENDOUS JOBS. WE ARE BRINGING GDP FROM REALLY 1% WHICH IS WHAT IT IS NOW IF SHE GOT IN IT WOULD BE LESS THAN ZERO. BUT WE'RE BRINGING IT FROM 1% UP TO 4% AND I ACTUALLY THINK WE CAN GO FIRE THAN 4%. I THINK YOU CAN GO TO 5 OR 6%. AND IF WE DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER ASKING ME A QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS MACHINE, WE WILL HAVE CREATED A TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC MACHINE ONCE AGAIN. TO DO THAT WE'RE TAKING BACK JOBS, THOUGHT GOING TO LET OUR COMPANIES BE RAIDED BY OTHER COUNTRIES. WHERE WE LOSE ALL OUR JOBS. WE DON'T MAKE OUR PRODUCT. IT'S VERY SAD. BUT I AM GOING TO CREATE THE KIND OF COUNTRY THAT WE WANT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF INDUSTRY THAT WE USED TO BE THERE WE'VE GIVEN IT UP. WE'VE BECOME VERY, VERY SLOPPY WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS MAKING THE BIGGEST DEALS -- BIGGER THAN COMPANIES, YOU TAKE THESE BIG COMPANIES, THESE TRAIT DEALS ARE FAR BIGGER THAN THE COMPANIES. YET WE DON'T USE OUR GREAT LEADERS, MANY OF WHOM BACK ME, MANY BACK HILLARY I MUST SAY. WE DON'T CREWS THOSE PEOPLE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE -- THESE ARE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO USE THEM TO NEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS. IS WE USE PEOPLE THAT GET THE POSITION BECAUSE THEY GAVE -- MADE A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION. AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH CHINA AND PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY MUCH SMARTER THAN THEY ARE. SO, WE HAVE TO USE OUR GREAT PEOPLE. BUT THAT BEING SAID, WE WILL CREATE AN ECONOMIC MACHINE THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN MANY DECADES. AND PEOPLE, CHRIS, WILL AGAIN GO BACK TO WORK AND THEY WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND WILL HAVE COMPANIES THAT WILL GROW AND EXPAND AND START FROM NEW.  SECRETARY CLINTON.  WELL, FIRST, WHEN I HEAR DONALD TALK LIKE THAT KNOW THAT HIS SLOGAN MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, I WONDER WHEN HE THOUGHT AMERICA WAS GREAT. AND BEFORE HE RUSHES SAYS BEFORE YOU AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE THERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZING OUR GOVERNMENT FOR DECADES. BACK IN 1987 HE TOOK OUT A $100,000 AD IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" DURING THE TIME WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT. AND BASICALLY SAID EXACTLY WHAT HE JUST SAID NOW. THAT WE WERE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE WORLD. HE WAS CRITICIZING PRESIDENT REAGAN, THIS IS THE WAY DONALD THINKS ABOUT HIMSELF, PUTS HIMSELF INTO THE MIDDLE SAYS YOU KNOW, I ALONE CAN FIX IT AS HE SAID ON THE CONVENTION STAGE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEBT WHICH IS THE ISSUE YOU ASKED ABOUT, CHRIS, I PAY FOR EVERYTHING I'M PROPOSING. I DO NOT ADD A PENNY TO THE NATIONAL DEBT. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR EDUCATION, HOW WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DOWN AND LOT OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT ALL THE TIME. I'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR WE ARE GOING WHERE THE MONEY S. WE ARE GOING TO ASK THE WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT THAT WILL SLOW DOWN OR DIMINISH OUR GROWTH. IN FACT I THINK JUST THE OPPOSITE. WE'LL HAVE WHAT ECONOMISTS CALLS MIDDLE-OUT GROWTH. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE FAMILIES OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHERE GROWTH WILL COME FROM. THAT'S WHY I WANT FOIN VEST IN YOU, I WANT TO INVEST IN YOUR FAMILY. I THINK THAT'S THE SMARTEST WAY TO GROW THE ECONOMY, TO MAKE THE ECONOMY FAIRER, WE JUST HAVE A BIG DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THIS. IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF OUR EXPERIENCES, YOU KNOW, HE STARTED OFF WITH HIS DAD AS A --  WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE HILLARY.  HE WAS A -- I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENCE THAT AFFECTS HOW WE SEE THE WORLD AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH THE ECONOMY.  TIME. THANK YOU.  COULD I JUST RESPOND?  WELL, NO.  WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.  RONALD REAGAN -- I DISAGREED WITH HIM. SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH TOUGHER ON TRADE EVEN THEN. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS -- FRANKLY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT.  ALL RIGHT. THE ONE LAST AREA I WANT TO GET TOWN WITH YOU IN THIS DEBATE IS THE FACT THAT THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF OUR DEBT IS ENTITLEMENTS, WHICH STREET 60% OF ALL FEDERAL SPENDING. COMMITTEE FOR FEDERAL RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKED AT BOTH OF YOUR PLANS NEITHER OF YOU HAS A SERIOUS PLAN THAT IS GOING TO SOLVE THE FACT THAT MEDICARE IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY IN THE 2020s SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY IN THE 2030s. AT THAT TIME RECIPIENTS ARE GOING TO TAKE HUGE CUTS IN THEIR BENEFITS. IN EFFECT THE FINAL QUESTION I WOULDN'T ASK YOU IN THIS REGARD IS LET ME START WITH YOU MR. TRUMP, WOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKE A DEAL TO SAVE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY THAT INCLUDED BOTH TAX INCREASES AND BENEFIT CUTS IN EFFECT A GRAND BARGAIN ON ENTITLEMENTS?  I'M CUTTING TAXES. WE'RE GOING TO GROW THE ECONOMY. IT'S GOING TO GROW --  THAT'S NOT THE -- GOING TO TOTALLY HELP YOU.  REPEAL AND REPLACE THE DISASTER KNOWN AS OBAMACARE. IT'S DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY. IT'S DESTROYING OUR BUSINESSES. OUR SMALL BUSINESS AND OUR BIG BUSINESSES. WE HAVE TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE KIND OF NUMBERS THAT THAT WILL COST US IN THE YEAR '17. IF WE DON'T REPEAL AND REPLACE, NOW IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO DIE OF ITS OWN WEIGHT. BUT OBAMACARE HAS TO GO. PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP 60 70 08%. NEXT YEAR GOING TO GO UP OVER 100% I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THE PREMIUMS HAVE STARTED AT LEAST THE PEOPLE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO KEEP OBAMACARE SHE WANTS TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE. IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE. BAD HEALTH CARE AT THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRICE. WE HAVE TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.  AND SECRETARY CLINTON, SAME QUESTION, BECAUSE AT THIS POINT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT TRUST FUNDS WILL RUN OUT OF MONEY. WILL YOU AS PRESIDENT CONSIDER A GRAND BARGAIN, A DEAL THAT INCLUDES BOTH TAX INCREASES AND BENEFIT CUTS TO TRY TO SAVE BOTH PROGRAMS.  WELL, CHRIS, I AM ON RECORD AS SAYING THAT WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND, THAT'S PART OF MY COMMITMENT TO RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYROLL CONTRIBUTION WILL GO UP AS WILL DONALD'S ASSUMING HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF IT. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REPLENISH THE --  SUCH A NASTY WOMAN.  BY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. THAT WILL COME FROM EITHER RAISINGS THE CAP AND/OR FINDING OTHER WAYS TO GET MORE MONEY SWEET. I WILL NOT CUT BENEFITS. I WANT TO ENHANCE BENEFITS FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS AND FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN DISADVANTAGED BY THE CURRENT SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM S. BUT WHAT DONALD IS PROPOSING WITH THESE MASSIVE TAX CUTS WILL RESULT IN A $20 TRILLION ADDITIONAL NATIONAL DEBT. THAT WILL HAVE DIRE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. I'LL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THE 'NORDABLE COMPARE ACT EXTENDED SOLVENCY OF THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND. IF HE REPEALS IT OUR MEDICARE PROBLEM GETS WORSE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS --  YOUR HUSBAND DISAGREES WITH YOU.  LONG TERM HEALTH CARE DRIVERS. WE'VE GOT TO GET COSTS DOWN INCREASE VALUE, EMPHASIZE WELLNESS. I HAVE A PLAN FOR DOING THAT. I THINK THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET ENTITLEMENT SPENDING UNDER CONTROL WITH MORE RESOURCES AND SMARTER DECISIONS.  THIS IS IS THE FINAL TIME PROBABLY TO BOTH OF YOUR DELIGHT THAT YOU'LL BE ON THE STAGE TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I WOULD LIKE TO END IT ON A POSITIVE NOTE. YOU HAD NOT AGREED TO CLOSING STATEMENTS. BUT SEEMS TO BE FUNNY WAY THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PREPARED CLOSING STATEMENTS. I'D LIKE YOU EACH TO TAKE -- PUT A CLOCK UP A MINUTE. AS FINAL QUESTION AND FINAL DEBATE TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHY THEY SHOULD ELECT YOU TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, THIS IS ANOTHER NEW MINI SEGMENT SECRETARY CLINTON YOUR TURN TO GO FIRST.  WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO EVERYONE WATCHING TONIGHT, THAT I'M REACHING OUT TO ALL AMERICANS, DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYBODY TO HELP MAKE OUR COUNTRY WHAT IT SHOULD BE. TO GROW THE ECONOMY, TO MAKE IT FAIRER, TO MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYONE. WE NEED YOUR TALENTS, YOUR SKILLS, YOUR COMMITMENTS, YOUR ENERGY YOUR AMBITION EACH BEEN PRIVILEGED SEE THE PRESIDENCY UP CLOSE. I KNOW THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY AND THE IN CREEDIBLE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING TO TRY TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR ALL OF YOU. I HAVE MADE THE CAUSE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES REALLY MY LIFE'S WORK. THAT'S WHAT MY MISSION WILL BE IN THE PRESIDENCY. I WILL STAND UP FOR FAMILIES AGAINST POWERFUL INTERESTS AGAINST CORPORATIONS. I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES, THAT YOUR KIDS HAVE GOOD EDUCATIONS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE. I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO SERVE AS YOUR PRESIDENT.  SECRETARY CLINTON, THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP?  SHE'S RAISING THE MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE SHE WANTS TO CONTROL. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. WHEN I STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN I STARTED IT VERY STRONGLY, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE HAVE DEPLETED MILITARY, IT HAS TO BE HELPED. HAS TO BE FIXED. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE ON EARTH IN OUR MILITARY. WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS. WE TAKE CARE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THEME COME INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, BETTER THAN WE TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. THAT CAPTAIN HAPPEN. OUR POLICEMAN AND WOMEN ARE DISRESPECTED. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER BUT WE NEED JUSTICE, TOO. OUR INNER CITIES ARE A DISASTER, YOU GET SHOT WALKING TO THE STORE, HAVE NO EDUCATION, THEY HAVE NO JOBS. WILL DO MORE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS THAN SHE CAN EVER DO IN TEN LIFE TIMES. ALL SHE'S DONE IS TALK TO THE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND TO THE LATINOS. BUT THEY GET THE VOTE THEN THEY COME BACK, SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND IT HAS TO START NOW. WE CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU GET HER.  THANK YOU, BOTH. SECRETARY CLINTON -- HOLD ON JUST A MOMENT, FOLKS. SECRETARY CLINTON, MR. TRUMP THANK YOU BOTH FOR PARTICIPATING. IN ALL THREE OF THESE DEBATES THAT BRINGS TO END THIS YEAR'S DEBATES SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, WE WANT TO THANK THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS AND STUDENTS FOR HAVING US. NOW THE DECISION IS UP TO YOU. MILLIONS HAVE ALREADY VOTED ELECTION DAY NOVEMBER 8 IS JUST 20 DAYS AWAY. ONE THING EVERYONE HERE CAN AGREE ON WE HOPE YOU WILL GO VOTE. IT IS ONE OF THE HONORS AND OBLIGATIONS OF LIVING IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT. [ Applause ]  Woodruff:  AND THAT WRAPS UP THE FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON. AS WE WATCH THE CANDIDATES WALK ACROSS THE STAGE TO SHAKE THE HAND OF THE MODERATOR. CHRIS WALLACE AND PRESUMABLY THEIR FAMILIES WILL JOIN THEM ON STAGE IN A MOMENT. JOINING ME HERE IN OUR WASHINGTON STUDIOS SYNDICATED COLUMNIST MARK SHIELDS, "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST DAVID BROOKS, AMY WALTER OF THE "COOK POLITICAL REPORT." DAVID BROOKS, IT STARTED OUT ON CIVIL NOTE. THAT LASTED ABOUT 15 OR 20 MINUTES THEN THEY GOT INTO A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS AROUND ABORTION, THE SUPREME COURT. BUT BY THE END OF IT DONALD TRUMP WAS CALLING HILLARY CLINTON A NASTY WOMAN. AND A LIAR AND WE HEARD A LOT.  I COUNTED 27 MINUTES OF IS CIVILITY. MAYBE EX SEATING EXPECTATIONS. I THOUGHT IT WAS -- HEADLINE OF THE NIGHT IS HE WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD SUPPORT THE ELECTION. HE SAID, I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE ABOUT THAT, ELECTION RESULTS THAT WILL BE THE
